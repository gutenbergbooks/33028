<br />
THE HAUNTED INHERITANCE</h2>


<p>The most extraordinary thing that ever
happened to me was my going back to town
on that day. I am a reasonable being; I
do not do such things. I was on a bicycling
tour with another man. We were far from
the mean cares of an unremunerative profession;
we were men not fettered by any
given address, any pledged date, any preconcerted
route. I went to bed weary and
cheerful, fell asleep a mere animal&mdash;a tired
dog after a day&rsquo;s hunting&mdash;and awoke at
four in the morning that creature of nerves
and fancies which is my other self, and which
has driven me to all the follies I have ever
kept company with. But even that second
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
self of mine, whining beast and traitor as
it is, has never played me such a trick as it
played then. Indeed, something in the result
of that day&rsquo;s rash act sets me wondering
whether after all it could have been I, or
even my other self, who moved in the
adventure; whether it was not rather some
power outside both of us ... but this is a
speculation as idle in me as uninteresting to
you, and so enough of it.</p>

<p>From four to seven I lay awake, the prey
of a growing detestation of bicycling tours,
friends, scenery, physical exertion, holidays.
By seven o&rsquo;clock I felt that I would rather
perish than spend another day in the society
of the other man&mdash;an excellent fellow, by
the way, and the best of company.</p>

<p>At half-past seven the post came. I saw
the postman through my window as I shaved.
I went down to get my letters&mdash;there were
none, naturally.</p>

<p>At breakfast I said: &ldquo;Edmundson, my
dear fellow, I am extremely sorry; but my
letters this morning compel me to return
to town at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I thought,&rdquo; said Edmundson&mdash;then
he stopped, and I saw that he had perceived
in time that this was no moment for reminding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
me that, having left no address, I could
have had no letters.</p>

<p>He looked sympathetic, and gave me what
there was left of the bacon. I suppose he
thought that it was a love affair or some such
folly. I let him think so; after all, no love affair
but would have seemed wise compared with
the blank idiocy of this sudden determination
to cut short a delightful holiday and go back
to those dusty, stuffy rooms in Gray&rsquo;s Inn.</p>

<p>After that first and almost pardonable lapse,
Edmundson behaved beautifully. I caught
the 9.17 train, and by half-past eleven I was
climbing my dirty staircase.</p>

<p>I let myself in and waded through a heap
of envelopes and wrappered circulars that
had drifted in through the letter-box, as
dead leaves drift into the areas of houses in
squares. All the windows were shut. Dust
lay thick on everything. My laundress had
evidently chosen this as a good time for her
holiday. I wondered idly where she spent
it. And now the close, musty smell of the
rooms caught at my senses, and I remembered
with a positive pang the sweet scent of the
earth and the dead leaves in that wood through
which, at this very moment, the sensible and
fortunate Edmundson would be riding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
The thought of dead leaves reminded me
of the heap of correspondence. I glanced
through it. Only one of all those letters
interested me in the least. It was from my
mother:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="address">
<p class="center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Elliot&rsquo;s Bay, Norfolk</span>,<br />
<i>17th August</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Lawrence</span>,&mdash;I have wonderful news
for you. Your great-uncle Sefton has died,
and left you half his immense property. The
other half is left to your second cousin Selwyn.
You must come home at once. There are
heaps of letters here for you, but I dare not
send them on, as goodness only knows where
you may be. I do wish you would remember
to leave an address. I send this to your
rooms, in case you have had the forethought
to instruct your charwoman to send your
letters on to you. It is a most handsome
fortune, and I am too happy about your
accession to it to scold you as you deserve,
but I hope this will be a lesson to you to
leave an address when next you go away.
Come home at once.&mdash;Your loving Mother,</p>

<p class="sig">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Margaret Sefton</span>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;It is the maddest will; everything
divided evenly between you two except the
house and estate. The will says you and
your cousin Selwyn are to meet there on
the 1st September following his death, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
presence of the family, and decide which of
you is to have the house. If you can&rsquo;t agree,
it&rsquo;s to be presented to the county for a lunatic
asylum. I should think so! He was always
so eccentric. The one who doesn&rsquo;t have the
house, etc., gets £20,000 extra. Of course
you will choose <i>that</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>P.P.S.</i>&mdash;Be sure to bring your under-shirts
with you&mdash;the air here is very keen of an
evening.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>I opened both the windows and lit a pipe.
Sefton Manor, that gorgeous old place,&mdash;I
knew its picture in Hasted, cradle of our
race, and so on&mdash;and a big fortune. I hoped
my cousin Selwyn would want the £20,000
more than he wanted the house. If he didn&rsquo;t&mdash;well,
perhaps my fortune might be large
enough to increase that £20,000 to a sum
that he <i>would</i> want.</p>

<p>And then, suddenly, I became aware that
this was the 31st of August, and that
to-morrow was the day on which I was to
meet my cousin Selwyn and &ldquo;the family,&rdquo;
and come to a decision about the house. I
had never, to my knowledge, heard of my
cousin Selwyn. We were a family rich in
collateral branches. I hoped he would be a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
reasonable young man. Also, I had never
seen Sefton Manor House, except in a print.
It occurred to me that I would rather see
the house before I saw the cousin.</p>

<p>I caught the next train to Sefton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s but a mile by the field way,&rdquo; said
the railway porter. &ldquo;You take the stile&mdash;the
first on the left&mdash;and follow the path till
you come to the wood. Then skirt along
the left of it, cater across the meadow at
the end, and you&rsquo;ll see the place right below
you in the vale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine old place, I hear,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All to pieces, though,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if it cost a couple o&rsquo;
hundred to put it to rights. Water coming
through the roof and all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But surely the owner&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he never lived there; not since his
son was taken. He lived in the lodge; it&rsquo;s
on the brow of the hill looking down on the
Manor House.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the house empty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As empty as a rotten nutshell, except
for the old sticks o&rsquo; furniture. Any one who
likes,&rdquo; added the porter, &ldquo;can lie there o&rsquo;
nights. But it wouldn&rsquo;t be me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean there&rsquo;s a ghost?&rdquo; I hope I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
kept any note of undue elation out of my
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hold with ghosts,&rdquo; said the porter
firmly, &ldquo;but my aunt was in service at the
lodge, and there&rsquo;s no doubt but <i>something</i>
walks there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;this is very interesting.
Can&rsquo;t you leave the station, and come across
to where beer is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind if I do,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;That
is so far as your standing a drop goes. But
I can&rsquo;t leave the station, so if you pour my
beer you must pour it dry, sir, as the saying
is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So I gave the man a shilling, and he told
me about the ghost at Sefton Manor House.
Indeed, about the ghosts, for there were, it
seemed, two; a lady in white, and a gentleman
in a slouch hat and black riding cloak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They do say,&rdquo; said my porter, &ldquo;as how
one of the young ladies once on a time was
wishful to elope, and started so to do&mdash;not
getting further than the hall door; her father,
thinking it to be burglars, fired out of the
window, and the happy pair fell on the
doorstep, corpses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it true, do you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The porter did not know. At any rate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
there was a tablet in the church to Maria
Sefton and George Ballard&mdash;&ldquo;and something
about in their death them not being divided.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I took the stile, I skirted the wood, I
&ldquo;catered&rdquo; across the meadow&mdash;and so I
came out on a chalky ridge held in a net
of pine roots, where dog violets grew. Below
stretched the green park, dotted with trees.
The lodge, stuccoed but solid, lay below me.
Smoke came from its chimneys. Lower still
lay the Manor House&mdash;red brick with grey
lichened mullions, a house in a thousand,
Elizabethan&mdash;and from its twisted beautiful
chimneys no smoke arose. I hurried across
the short turf towards the Manor House.</p>

<p>I had no difficulty in getting into the great
garden. The bricks of the wall were everywhere
displaced or crumbling. The ivy had
forced the coping stones away; each red
buttress offered a dozen spots for foothold.
I climbed the wall and found myself in a
garden&mdash;oh! but such a garden. There are
not half a dozen such in England&mdash;ancient
box hedges, rosaries, fountains, yew tree
avenues, bowers of clematis (now feathery
in its seeding time), great trees, grey-grown
marble balustrades and steps, terraces, green
lawns, one green lawn, in especial, girt round
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
with a sweet briar hedge, and in the middle
of this lawn a sundial. All this was mine,
or, to be more exact, might be mine, should
my cousin Selwyn prove to be a person of
sense. How I prayed that he might not be
a person of taste! That he might be a
person who liked yachts or racehorses or
diamonds, or motor-cars, or anything that
money can buy, not a person who liked
beautiful Elizabethan houses, and gardens
old beyond belief.</p>

<p>The sundial stood on a mass of masonry,
too low and wide to be called a pillar. I
mounted the two brick steps and leaned over
to read the date and the motto:</p>

<div class="blockquot">&ldquo;Tempus fugit manet amor.&rdquo;</div>

<p>The date was 1617, the initials S. S. surmounted
it. The face of the dial was
unusually ornate&mdash;a wreath of stiffly drawn
roses was traced outside the circle of the
numbers. As I leaned there a sudden movement
on the other side of the pedestal compelled
my attention. I leaned over a little
further to see what had rustled&mdash;a rat&mdash;a
rabbit? A flash of pink struck at my eyes.
A lady in a pink dress was sitting on the
step at the other side of the sundial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
I suppose some exclamation escaped me&mdash;the
lady looked up. Her hair was dark, and
her eyes; her face was pink and white, with
a few little gold-coloured freckles on nose
and on cheek bones. Her dress was of pink
cotton stuff, thin and soft. She looked like
a beautiful pink rose.</p>

<p>Our eyes met.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I had no
idea&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; there I stopped and tried to crawl
back to firm ground. Graceful explanations
are not best given by one sprawling on his
stomach across a sundial.</p>

<p>By the time I was once more on my feet
she too was standing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a beautiful old place,&rdquo; she said
gently, and, as it seemed, with a kindly wish
to relieve my embarrassment. She made a
movement as if to turn away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite a show place,&rdquo; said I stupidly
enough, but I was still a little embarrassed,
and I wanted to say something&mdash;anything&mdash;to
arrest her departure. You have no idea
how pretty she was. She had a straw hat in
her hand, dangling by soft black ribbons.
Her hair was all fluffy-soft&mdash;like a child&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;I suppose you have seen the house?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
She paused, one foot still on the lower
step of the sundial, and her face seemed to
brighten at the touch of some idea as sudden
as welcome.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;no,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The fact is&mdash;I
wanted frightfully to see the house; in fact,
I&rsquo;ve come miles and miles on purpose, but
there&rsquo;s no one to let me in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The people at the lodge?&rdquo; I suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&mdash;the fact is I&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t want to be shown round. I want
to explore!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at me critically. Her eyes
dwelt on my right hand, which lay on
the sundial. I have always taken reasonable
care of my hands, and I wore a
good ring, a sapphire, cut with the Sefton
arms: an heirloom, by the way. Her glance
at my hand preluded a longer glance at
my face. Then she shrugged her pretty
shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh well,&rdquo; she said, and it was as if she
had said plainly, &ldquo;I see that you are a gentleman
and a decent fellow. Why should I not
look over the house in your company? Introductions?
Bah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this her shrug said without ambiguity
as without words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; I hazarded, &ldquo;I could get the
keys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you really care very much for old
houses?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I care so much that I nearly broke into
this one. I should have done it quite if the
windows had been an inch or two lower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am an inch or two higher,&rdquo; said I,
standing squarely so as to make the most
of my six-feet beside her five-feet-five or
thereabouts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;if you only would!&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>She led the way past the marble basin of
the fountain, and along the historic yew
avenue, planted, like all old yew avenues,
by that industrious gardener our Eighth
Henry. Then across a lawn, through a
winding, grassy, shrubbery path, that ended
at a green door in the garden wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can lift this latch with a hairpin,&rdquo;
said she, and therewith lifted it.</p>

<p>We walked into a courtyard. Young
grass grew green between the grey flags on
which our steps echoed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the window,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You
see there&rsquo;s a pane broken. If you could get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
on to the window-sill, you could get your
hand in and undo the hasp, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll let me in by the kitchen door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did it. My conscience called me a burglar&mdash;in
vain. Was it not my own, or as good
as my own house?</p>

<p>I let her in at the back door. We walked
through the big dark kitchen where the
old three-legged pot towered large on the
hearth, and the old spits and firedogs still
kept their ancient place. Then through
another kitchen where red rust was making
its full meal of a comparatively modern
range.</p>

<p>Then into the great hall, where the old
armour and the buff-coats and round-caps
hang on the walls, and where the carved
stone staircases run at each side up to the
gallery above.</p>

<p>The long tables in the middle of the hall
were scored by the knives of the many who
had eaten meat there&mdash;initials and dates were
cut into them. The roof was groined, the
windows low-arched.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but what a place!&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;this
must be much older than the rest of it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Evidently. About 1300, I should say.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh, let us explore the rest,&rdquo; she cried;
&ldquo;it is really a comfort not to have a guide,
but only a person like you who just guesses
comfortably at dates. I should hate to be
told <i>exactly</i> when this hall was built.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We explored ball-room and picture gallery,
white parlour and library. Most of the rooms
were furnished&mdash;all heavily, some magnificently&mdash;but
everything was dusty and
faded.</p>

<p>It was in the white parlour, a spacious
panelled room on the first floor, that she
told me the ghost story, substantially the
same as my porter&rsquo;s tale, only in one respect
different.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so, just as she was leaving this very
room&mdash;yes, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s this room, because
the woman at the inn pointed out this
double window and told me so&mdash;just as the
poor lovers were creeping out of the door,
the cruel father came quickly out of some
dark place and killed them both. So now
they haunt it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a terrible thought,&rdquo; said I gravely.
&ldquo;How would you like to live in a haunted
house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I; it would be too&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; my speech
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
would have ended flippantly, but for the
grave set of her features.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder who <i>will</i> live here?&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;The owner is just dead. They say it is
an awful house, full of ghosts. Of course
one is not afraid now&rdquo;&mdash;the sunlight lay
golden and soft on the dusty parquet of the
floor&mdash;&ldquo;but at night, when the wind wails,
and the doors creak, and the things rustle,
oh, it must be awful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear the house has been left to
two people, or rather one is to have the
house, and the other a sum of money,&rdquo;
said I. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beautiful house, full of
beautiful things, but I should think at least
one of the heirs would rather have the
money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I should think so. I wonder
whether the heirs know about the ghost?
The lights can be seen from the inn, you
know, at twelve o&rsquo;clock, and they see the
ghost in white at the window.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never the black one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I suppose so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ghosts don&rsquo;t appear together?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;whoever it is that
manages such things knows that the poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
ghosts would like to be together, so it won&rsquo;t
let them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shivered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we have seen all over
the house; let us get back into the sunshine.
Now I will go out, and you shall bolt the
door after me, and then you can come out
by the window. Thank you so much for
all the trouble you have taken. It has
really been quite an adventure....&rdquo;</p>

<p>I rather liked that expression, and she
hastened to spoil it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;... Quite an adventure going all over this
glorious old place, and looking at everything
one wanted to see, and not just at what the
housekeeper didn&rsquo;t mind one&rsquo;s looking at.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She passed through the door, but when I
had closed it and prepared to lock it, I
found that the key was no longer in the
lock. I looked on the floor&mdash;I felt in my
pockets, and at last, wandering back into
the kitchen, discovered it on the table, where
I swear I never put it.</p>

<p>When I had fitted that key into the lock
and turned it, and got out of the window
and made that fast, I dropped into the yard.
No one shared its solitude with me. I
searched garden and pleasure grounds, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
never a glimpse of pink rewarded my
anxious eyes. I found the sundial again,
and stretched myself along the warm brick
of the wide step where she had sat: and
called myself a fool.</p>

<p>I had let her go. I did not know her
name; I did not know where she lived;
she had been at the inn, but probably only
for lunch. I should never see her again,
and certainly in that event I should never
see again such dark, soft eyes, such hair,
such a contour of cheek and chin, such a
frank smile&mdash;in a word, a girl with whom
it would be so delightfully natural for me
to fall in love. For all the time she had
been talking to me of architecture and
archæology, of dates and periods, of carvings
and mouldings, I had been recklessly falling
in love with the idea of falling in love with
her. I had cherished and adored this
delightful possibility, and now my chance
was over. Even I could not definitely fall
in love after one interview with a girl I was
never to see again! And falling in love is
so pleasant! I cursed my lost chance, and
went back to the inn. I talked to the
waiter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, a lady in pink had lunched there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
with a party. Had gone on to the Castle.
A party from Tonbridge it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barnhurst Castle is close to Sefton Manor.
The inn lays itself out to entertain persons
who come in brakes and carve their names
on the walls of the Castle keep. The inn
has a visitors&rsquo; book. I examined it. Some
twenty feminine names. Any one might be
hers. The waiter looked over my shoulder.
I turned the pages.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only parties staying in the house in this
part of the book,&rdquo; said the waiter.</p>

<p>My eye caught one name. &ldquo;Selwyn
Sefton,&rdquo; in a clear, round, black hand-writing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Staying here?&rdquo; I pointed to the name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; came to-day, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I have a private sitting-room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had one. I ordered my dinner to be
served in it, and I sat down and considered
my course of action. Should I invite my
cousin Selwyn to dinner, ply him with wine,
and exact promises? Honour forbade.
Should I seek him out and try to establish
friendly relations? To what end?</p>

<p>Then I saw from my window a young man
in a light-checked suit, with a face at once
pallid and coarse. He strolled along the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
gravel path, and a woman&rsquo;s voice in the
garden called &ldquo;Selwyn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He disappeared in the direction of the
voice. I don&rsquo;t think I ever disliked a man
so much at first sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brute,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;why should he have the
house? He&rsquo;d stucco it all over as likely as
not; perhaps let it! He&rsquo;d never stand the
ghosts, either&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the inexcusable, daring idea of my
life came to me, striking me rigid&mdash;a blow
from my other self. It must have been a
minute or two before my muscles relaxed
and my arms fell at my sides.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>I dined. I told the people of the house
not to sit up for me. I was going to see
friends in the neighbourhood, and might stay
the night with them. I took my Inverness
cape with me on my arm and my soft felt
hat in my pocket. I wore a light suit and
a straw hat.</p>

<p>Before I started I leaned cautiously from
my window. The lamp at the bow window
next to mine showed me the pallid young
man, smoking a fat, reeking cigar. I hoped
he would continue to sit there smoking.
His window looked the right way; and if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
he didn&rsquo;t see what I wanted him to see
some one else in the inn would. The landlady
had assured me that I should disturb
no one if I came in at half-past twelve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We hardly keep country hours here, sir,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;on account of so much excursionist
business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I bought candles in the village, and, as
I went down across the park in the soft darkness,
I turned again and again to be sure
that the light and the pallid young man
were still at that window. It was now past
eleven.</p>

<p>I got into the house and lighted a candle,
and crept through the dark kitchens, whose
windows, I knew, did not look towards the
inn. When I came to the hall I blew
out my candle. I dared not show light
prematurely, and in the unhaunted part of
the house.</p>

<p>I gave myself a nasty knock against one
of the long tables, but it helped me to get
my bearings, and presently I laid my hand
on the stone balustrade of the great staircase.
You would hardly believe me if I were to
tell you truly of my sensations as I began
to go up these stairs. I am not a coward&mdash;at
least, I had never thought so till then&mdash;but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the absolute darkness unnerved me. I
had to go slowly, or I should have lost my
head and blundered up the stairs three at a
time, so strong was the feeling of something&mdash;something
uncanny&mdash;just behind me.</p>

<p>I set my teeth. I reached the top of the
stairs, felt along the walls, and after a false
start, which landed me in the great picture
gallery, I found the white parlour, entered it,
closed the door, and felt my way to a little
room without a window, which we had
decided must have been a powdering-room.</p>

<p>Here I ventured to re-light my candle.</p>

<p>The white parlour, I remembered, was fully
furnished. Returning to it I struck one match,
and by its flash determined the way to the
mantelpiece.</p>

<p>Then I closed the powdering-room door
behind me. I felt my way to the mantelpiece
and took down the two brass twenty-lighted
candelabra. I placed these on a table
a yard or two from the window, and in them
set up my candles. It is astonishingly difficult
in the dark to do anything, even a thing so
simple as the setting up of a candle.</p>

<p>Then I went back into my little room,
put on the Inverness cape and the slouch
hat, and looked at my watch. Eleven-thirty.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
I must wait. I sat down and waited. I
thought how rich I was&mdash;the thought fell
flat; I wanted this house. I thought of my
beautiful pink lady; but I put that thought
aside; I had an inward consciousness that
my conduct, more heroic than enough in
one sense, would seem mean and crafty in
her eyes. Only ten minutes had passed. I
could not wait till twelve. The chill of the
night and of the damp, unused house, and,
perhaps, some less material influence, made
me shiver.</p>

<p>I opened the door, crept on hands and
knees to the table, and, carefully keeping
myself below the level of the window, I
reached up a trembling arm, and lighted, one
by one, my forty candles. The room was a
blaze of light. My courage came back to
me with the retreat of the darkness. I was
far too excited to know what a fool I was
making of myself. I rose boldly, and struck
an attitude over against the window, where
the candle-light shone upon as well as behind
me. My Inverness was flung jauntily over
my shoulder, my soft, black felt twisted and
slouched over my eyes.</p>

<p>There I stood for the world, and particularly
for my cousin Selwyn, to see, the very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
image of the ghost that haunted that chamber.
And from my window I could see the light
in that other window, and indistinctly the
lounging figure there. Oh, my cousin Selwyn,
I wished many things to your address in that
moment! For it was only a moment that I
had to feel brave and daring in. Then I
heard, deep down in the house, a sound, very
slight, very faint. Then came silence. I drew
a deep breath. The silence endured. And I
stood by my lighted window.</p>

<p>After a very long time, as it seemed, I
heard a board crack, and then a soft rustling
sound that drew near and seemed to pause
outside the very door of my parlour.</p>

<p>Again I held my breath, and now I thought
of the most horrible story Poe ever wrote&mdash;&ldquo;The
Fall of the House of Usher&rdquo;&mdash;and I
fancied I saw the handle of that door move.
I fixed my eyes on it. The fancy passed:
and returned.</p>

<p>Then again there was silence. And then
the door opened with a soft, silent suddenness,
and I saw in the doorway a figure in
trailing white. Its eyes blazed in a death-white
face. It made two ghostly, gliding
steps forward, and my heart stood still. I
had not thought it possible for a man to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
experience so sharp a pang of sheer terror. I
had masqueraded as one of the ghosts in this
accursed house. Well, the other ghost&mdash;the
real one&mdash;had come to meet me. I do not
like to dwell on that moment. The only
thing which it pleases me to remember is that
I did not scream or go mad. I think I stood
on the verge of both.</p>

<p>The ghost, I say, took two steps forward;
then it threw up its arms, the lighted taper
it carried fell on the floor, and it reeled back
against the door with its arms across its face.</p>

<p>The fall of the candle woke me as from a
nightmare. It fell solidly, and rolled away
under the table.</p>

<p>I perceived that my ghost was human. I
cried incoherently: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake&mdash;it&rsquo;s
all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ghost dropped its hands and turned
agonised eyes on me. I tore off my cloak
and hat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;didn&rsquo;t&mdash;scream,&rdquo; she said, and with
that I sprang forward and caught her in my
arms&mdash;my poor, pink lady&mdash;white now as a
white rose.</p>

<p>I carried her into the powdering-room, and
left one candle with her, extinguishing the
others hastily, for now I saw what in my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
extravagant folly had escaped me before, that
my ghost exhibition might bring the whole
village down on the house. I tore down the
long corridor and double locked the doors
leading from it to the staircase, then back to
the powdering-room and the prone white rose.
How, in the madness of that night&rsquo;s folly, I
had thought to bring a brandy-flask passes my
understanding. But I had done it. Now I
rubbed her hands with the spirit. I rubbed
her temples, I tried to force it between her
lips, and at last she sighed and opened her
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;thank God&mdash;thank God!&rdquo; I cried,
for indeed I had almost feared that my mad
trick had killed her. &ldquo;Are you better?
oh, poor little lady, are you better?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She moved her head a little on my arm.</p>

<p>Again she sighed, and her eyes closed. I
gave her more brandy. She took it, choked,
raised herself against my shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right now,&rdquo; she said faintly. &ldquo;It
served me right. How silly it all is!&rdquo; Then
she began to laugh, and then she began to cry.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that we heard voices
on the terrace below. She clutched at my
arm in a frenzy of terror, the bright tears
glistening on her cheeks.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! not any more, not any more,&rdquo; she
cried. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; I said, taking her hands strongly
in mine. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve played the fool; so have
you. We must play the man now. The
people in the village have seen the lights&mdash;that&rsquo;s
all. They think we&rsquo;re burglars. They
can&rsquo;t get in. Keep quiet, and they&rsquo;ll go
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But when they did go away they left the
local constable on guard. He kept guard like
a man till daylight began to creep over the
hill, and then he crawled into the hayloft and
fell asleep, small blame to him.</p>

<p>But through those long hours I sat beside
her and held her hand. At first she clung to
me as a frightened child clings, and her tears
were the prettiest, saddest things to see. As
we grew calmer we talked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did it to frighten my cousin,&rdquo; I owned.
&ldquo;I meant to have told you to-day, I mean
yesterday, only you went away. I am
Lawrence Sefton, and the place is to go either
to me or to my cousin Selwyn. And I
wanted to frighten him off it. But you, why
did you&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even then I couldn&rsquo;t see. She looked at
me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how I ever could have
thought I was brave enough to do it, but I
did want the house so, and I wanted to
frighten you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To frighten <i>me</i>. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I am your cousin Selwyn,&rdquo; she
said, hiding her face in her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you knew me?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By your ring,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I saw your
father wear it when I was a little girl. Can&rsquo;t
we get back to the inn now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not unless you want every one to know
how silly we have been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d forgive me,&rdquo; she said when
we had talked awhile, and she had even
laughed at the description of the pallid young
man on whom I had bestowed, in my mind,
her name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wrong is mutual,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;we will
exchange forgivenesses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said eagerly. &ldquo;Because
I knew it was you, and you didn&rsquo;t
know it was me: you wouldn&rsquo;t have tried
to frighten <i>me</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know I wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; My voice was
tenderer than I meant it to be.</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who is to have the house?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
&ldquo;Why you, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, because!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we put off the decision?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible. We must decide to-morrow&mdash;to-day
I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, when we meet to-morrow&mdash;I mean
to-day&mdash;with lawyers and chaperones and
mothers and relations, give me one word
alone with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, with docility.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she said presently, &ldquo;I
can never respect myself again? To undertake
a thing like that, and then be so horribly
frightened. Oh! I thought you really <i>were</i>
the other ghost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you a secret,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I
thought <i>you</i> were, and I was much more
frightened than you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh well,&rdquo; she said, leaning against my
shoulder as a tired child might have done,
&ldquo;if you were frightened too, Cousin Lawrence,
I don&rsquo;t mind so very, very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was soon afterwards that, cautiously
looking out of the parlour window for the
twentieth time, I had the happiness of seeing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
the local policeman disappear into the stable
rubbing his eyes.</p>

<p>We got out of the window on the other
side of the house, and went back to the inn
across the dewy park. The French window
of the sitting-room which had let her out
let us both in. No one was stirring, so no
one save she and I were any the wiser as
to that night&rsquo;s work.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It was like a garden party next day, when
lawyers and executors and aunts and relations
met on the terrace in front of Sefton Manor
House.</p>

<p>Her eyes were downcast. She followed
her Aunt demurely over the house and the
grounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your decision,&rdquo; said my great-uncle&rsquo;s
solicitor, &ldquo;has to be given within the hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My cousin and I will announce it within
that time,&rdquo; I said and I at once gave her my
arm.</p>

<p>Arrived at the sundial we stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is my proposal,&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;we will say
that we decide that the house is yours&mdash;we
will spend the £20,000 in restoring it and the
grounds. By the time that&rsquo;s done we can
decide who is to have it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
&ldquo;But how?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll draw lots, or toss a halfpenny,
or anything you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather decide now,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;<i>you</i>
take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, <i>you</i> shall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather you had it. I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t feel so
greedy as I did yesterday,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither do I. Or at any rate not in the
same way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do&mdash;do take the house,&rdquo; she said very
earnestly.</p>

<p>Then I said: &ldquo;My cousin Selwyn, unless
you take the house, I shall make you an
offer of marriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Oh!</i>&rdquo; she breathed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when you have declined it, on the
very proper ground of our too slight acquaintance,
I will take my turn at declining. I will
decline the house. Then, if you are obdurate,
it will become an asylum. Don&rsquo;t be obdurate.
Pretend to take the house and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at me rather piteously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I will pretend to
take the house, and when it is restored&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll spin the penny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So before the waiting relations the house
was adjudged to my cousin Selwyn. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
the restoration was complete I met Selwyn
at the sundial. We had met there often in
the course of the restoration, in which business
we both took an extravagant interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll spin the penny.
Heads you take the house, tails it comes
to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I spun the coin&mdash;it fell on the brick steps
of the sundial, and stuck upright there,
wedged between two bricks. She laughed;
I laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not <i>my</i> house,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not <i>my</i> house,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; said I, and we were neither of us
laughing then, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t it be <i>our</i> house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, thank God, our house it is.</p>

<h2 class="padtop smlpadb">II<br />
<br />
THE POWER OF DARKNESS</h2>


<p>It was an enthusiastic send-off. Half the
students from her Atelier were there, and
twice as many more from other studios. She
had been the belle of the Artists&rsquo; Quarter in
Montparnasse for three golden months. Now
she was off to the Riviera to meet her people,
and every one she knew was at the Gare de
Lyons to catch the pretty last glimpse of her.
And, as had been more than once said late of
an evening, &ldquo;to see her was to love her.&rdquo;
She was one of those agitating blondes, with
the naturally rippled hair, the rounded rose-leaf
cheeks, the large violet-blue eyes that
look all things and mean Heaven alone
knows how little. She held her court like a
queen, leaning out of the carriage window and
receiving bouquets, books, journals, long last
words, and last longing looks. All eyes were
on her, and her eyes were for all&mdash;and her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
smile. For all but one, that is. Not a single
glance went Edward&rsquo;s way, and Edward, tall,
lean, gaunt, with big eyes, straight nose, and
mouth somewhat too small, too beautiful,
seemed to grow thinner and paler before
one&rsquo;s eyes. One pair of eyes at least saw
the miracle worked, the paling of what had
seemed absolute pallor, the revelation of the
bones of a face that seemed already covered
but by the thinnest possible veil of flesh.</p>

<p>And the man whose eyes saw this rejoiced,
for he loved her, like the rest, or not like the
rest; and he had had Edward&rsquo;s face before him
for the last month, in that secret shrine where
we set the loved and the hated, the shrine
that is lighted by a million lamps kindled at
the soul&rsquo;s flame, the shrine that leaps into
dazzling glow when the candles are out and
one lies alone on hot pillows to outface the
night and the light as best one may.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, good-bye, good-bye, all of you,&rdquo; said
Rose. &ldquo;I shall miss you&mdash;oh, you don&rsquo;t
know how I shall miss you all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gathered the glances of her friends and
her worshippers on her own glance, as one
gathers jewels on a silken string. The eyes
of Edward alone seemed to escape her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Em voiture, messieurs et dames.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Folk drew back from the train. There
was a whistle. And then at the very last
little moment of all, as the train pulled
itself together for the start, her eyes met
Edward&rsquo;s eyes. And the other man saw
the meeting, and he knew&mdash;which was more
than Edward did.</p>

<p>So, when the light of life having been
borne away in the retreating train, the
broken-hearted group dispersed, the other
man, whose name by the way was Vincent,
linked his arm in Edward&rsquo;s and asked
cheerily: &ldquo;Whither away, sweet nymph?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m off home,&rdquo; said Edward. &ldquo;The
7.20 to Calais.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sick of Paris?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One has to see one&rsquo;s people sometimes,
don&rsquo;t you know, hang it all!&rdquo; was Edward&rsquo;s
way of expressing the longing that tore
him for the old house among the brown
woods of Kent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No attraction here now, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The chief attraction has gone, certainly,&rdquo;
Edward made himself say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there are as good fish in the
sea&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fishing isn&rsquo;t my trade,&rdquo; said Edward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The beautiful Rose!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said Vincent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
Edward raised hurriedly the only shield
he could find. It happened to be the
truth as he saw it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of course, we&rsquo;re all in
love with her&mdash;and all hopelessly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vincent perceived that this was truth,
as Edward saw it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do till your train
goes?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Café, I suppose, and a
vilely early dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look in at the Musée Grévin,&rdquo;
said Vincent.</p>

<p>The two were friends. They had been
school-fellows, and this is a link that
survives many a strain too strong to be
resisted by more intimate and vital bonds.
And they were fellow-students, though that
counts for little or much&mdash;as you take it.
Besides, Vincent knew something about
Edward that no one else of their age and
standing even guessed. He knew that
Edward was afraid of the dark, and why.
He had found it out that Christmas that
the two had spent at an English country
house. The house was full: there was a
dance. There were to be theatricals. Early
in the new year the hostess meant to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
&ldquo;move house&rdquo; to an old convent, built in
Tudor times, a beautiful place with terraces
and clipped yew trees, castellated battlements,
a moat, swans, and a ghost story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You boys,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;must put up
with a shake-down in the new house. I
hope the ghost won&rsquo;t worry you. She&rsquo;s
a nun with a bunch of keys and no eyes.
Comes and breathes softly on the back of
your neck when you&rsquo;re shaving. Then you
see her in the glass, and, as often as not,
you cut your throat.&rdquo; She laughed. So did
Edward and Vincent, and the other young
men; there were seven or eight of them.</p>

<p>But that night, when sparse candles had
lighted &ldquo;the boys&rdquo; to their rooms, when
the last pipe had been smoked, the last
good-night said, there came a fumbling
with the handle of Vincent&rsquo;s door. Edward
entered an unwieldy figure clasping pillows,
trailing blankets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the deuce?&rdquo; queried Vincent in
natural amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll turn in here on the floor, if you
don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; said Edward. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s
beastly rot, but I can&rsquo;t stand it. The room
they&rsquo;ve put me into, it&rsquo;s an attic as big as
a barn&mdash;and there&rsquo;s a great door at the end,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
eight feet high&mdash;raw oak it is&mdash;and it leads
into a sort of horror-hole&mdash;bare beams and
rafters, and black as Hell. I know I&rsquo;m an
abject duffer, but there it is&mdash;I can&rsquo;t face
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vincent was sympathetic, though he had
never known a night-terror that could not
be exorcised by pipe, book, and candle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know, old chap. There&rsquo;s no reasoning
about these things,&rdquo; said he, and so on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t despise me more than I despise
myself,&rdquo; Edward said. &ldquo;I feel a crawling
hound. But it is so. I had a scare when I
was a kid, and it seems to have left a sort
of brand on me. I&rsquo;m branded &lsquo;coward,&rsquo; old
man, and the feel of it&rsquo;s not nice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Vincent was sympathetic, and the
poor little tale came out. How Edward,
eight years old, and greedy as became his
little years, had sneaked down, night-clad, to
pick among the outcomings of a dinner-party,
and how, in the hall, dark with the
light of an &ldquo;artistic&rdquo; coloured glass lantern,
a white figure had suddenly faced him&mdash;leaned
towards him it seemed, pointed lead-white
hands at his heart. That next day,
finding him weak from his fainting fit, had
shown the horror to be but a statue, a new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
purchase of his father&rsquo;s, had mattered not
one whit.</p>

<p>Edward had shared Vincent&rsquo;s room, and
Vincent, alone of all men, shared Edward&rsquo;s
secret.</p>

<p>And now, in Paris, Rose speeding away
towards Cannes, Vincent said: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look
in at the Musée Grévin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Musée Grévin is a wax-work show.
Your mind, at the word, flies instantly to
the excellent exhibition founded by the
worthy Madame Tussaud, and you think
you know what wax-works mean. But you
are wrong. The exhibition of Madame
Tussaud&mdash;in these days, at any rate&mdash;is
the work of <i>bourgeois</i> for a <i>bourgeois</i> class.
The Musée Grévin contains the work of
artists for a nation of artists. Wax, modelled
and retouched till it seems as near life as
death is: this is what one sees at the Musée
Grévin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look in at the Musée Grévin,&rdquo; said
Vincent. He remembered the pleasant thrill
the Musée had given him, and wondered what
sort of a thrill it would give his friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hate museums,&rdquo; said Edward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a museum,&rdquo; Vincent said, and
truly; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just wax-works.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Edward indifferently.
And they went. They reached the doors
of the Musée in the grey-brown dusk of a
February evening.</p>

<p>One walks along a bare, narrow corridor,
much like the entrance to the stalls of the
Standard Theatre, and such daylight as
there may be fades away behind one, and
one finds oneself in a square hall, heavily
decorated, and displaying with its electric
lights Loie Fuller in her accordion-pleated
skirts, and one or two other figures not
designed to quicken the pulse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very like Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said
Edward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Vincent said; &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they passed through an arch, and
behold, a long room with waxen groups life-like
behind glass&mdash;the <i>coulisses</i> of the Opéra,
Kitchener at Fashoda&mdash;this last with a
desert background lit by something convincingly
like desert sunlight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; said Edward, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s jolly
good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Vincent again; &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edward&rsquo;s interest grew. The things were
so convincing, so very nearly alive. Given
the right angle, their glass eyes met one&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
own, and seemed to exchange with one
meaning glances.</p>

<p>Vincent led the way to an arched door
labelled: &ldquo;Gallerie de la Revolution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There one saw, almost in the living, suffering
body, poor Marie Antoinette in prison in
the Temple, her little son on his couch of rags,
the rats eating from his platter, the brutal
Simon calling to him from the grated window;
one almost heard the words, &ldquo;Ho la, little
Capet&mdash;are you asleep?&rdquo;</p>

<p>One saw Marat bleeding in his bath&mdash;the
brave Charlotte eyeing him&mdash;the very tiles of
the bath-room, the glass of the windows with,
outside, the very sunlight, as it seemed, of
1793 on that &ldquo;yellow July evening, the
thirteenth of the month.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The spectators did not move in a public
place among wax-work figures. They peeped
through open doors into rooms where history
seemed to be re-lived. The rooms were
lighted each by its own sun, or lamp, or
candle. The spectators walked among
shadows that might have oppressed a nervous
person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine, eh?&rdquo; said Vincent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Edward; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s wonderful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A turn of a corner brought them to a room.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Marie Antoinette fainting, supported by her
ladies; poor fat Louis by the window looking
literally sick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with them all?&rdquo; said
Edward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at the window,&rdquo; said Vincent.</p>

<p>There was a window to the room. Outside
was sunshine&mdash;the sunshine of 1792&mdash;and,
gleaming in it, blonde hair flowing, red mouth
half open, what seemed the just-severed head
of a beautiful woman. It was raised on a
pike, so that it seemed to be looking in at
the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say!&rdquo; said Edward, and the head on the
pike seemed to sway before his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame de Lamballe. Good thing, isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; said Vincent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s altogether too much of a good thing,&rdquo;
said Edward. &ldquo;Look here&mdash;I&rsquo;ve had enough
of this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you must just see the Catacombs,&rdquo;
said Vincent; &ldquo;nothing bloody, you know.
Only Early Christians being married and
baptized, and all that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He led the way, down some clumsy steps
to the cellars which the genius of a great
artist has transformed into the exact semblance
of the old Catacombs at Rome. The same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
rough hewing of rock, the same sacred tokens
engraved strongly and simply; and among the
arches of these subterranean burrowings the
life of the Early Christians, their sacraments,
their joys, their sorrows&mdash;all expressed in
groups of wax-work as like life as Death is.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this is very fine, you know,&rdquo; said
Edward, getting his breath again after
Madame de Lamballe, and his imagination
loved the thought of the noble sufferings
and refrainings of these first lovers of the
Crucified Christ.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Vincent for the third time;
&ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They passed the baptism and the burying
and the marriage. The tableaux were
sufficiently lighted, but little light strayed to
the narrow passage where the two men
walked, and the darkness seemed to press,
tangible as a bodily presence, against Edward&rsquo;s
shoulder. He glanced backward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, then,&rdquo; said Vincent.</p>

<p>They turned the corner&mdash;and a blaze of
Italian sunlight struck at their eyes with
positive dazzlement. There lay the Coliseum&mdash;tier
on tier of eager faces under the blue
sky of Italy. They were level with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
arena. In the arena were crosses; from
them drooped bleeding figures. On the sand
beasts prowled, bodies lay. They saw it all
through bars. They seemed to be in the
place where the chosen victims waited their
turn, waited for the lions and the crosses,
the palm and the crown. Close by Edward
was a group&mdash;an old man, a woman&mdash;children.
He could have touched them
with his hand. The woman and the man
stared in an agony of terror straight in the
eyes of a snarling tiger, ten feet long, that
stood up on its hind feet and clawed through
the bars at them. The youngest child, only,
unconscious of the horror, laughed in the
very face of it. Roman soldiers, unmoved
in military vigilance, guarded the group of
martyrs. In a low cage to the left more
wild beasts cringed and seemed to growl, unfed.
Within the grating on the wide circle
of yellow sand lions and tigers drank the
blood of Christians. Close against the bars
a great lion sucked the chest of a corpse
on whose blood-stained face the horror of
the death-agony was printed plain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; said Edward. Vincent took
his arm suddenly, and he started with what
was almost a shriek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
&ldquo;What a nervous chap you are!&rdquo; said
Vincent complacently, as they regained the
street where the lights were, and the sound
of voices and the movement of live human
beings&mdash;all that warms and awakens nerves
almost paralysed by the life in death of waxen
immobility.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Edward. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have
a vermouth, shall we? There&rsquo;s something
uncanny about those wax things. They&rsquo;re
like life&mdash;but they&rsquo;re much more like death.
Suppose they moved? I don&rsquo;t feel at all
sure that they don&rsquo;t move, when the lights
are all out, and there&rsquo;s no one there.&rdquo;
He laughed. &ldquo;I suppose you were never
frightened, Vincent?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was once,&rdquo; said Vincent, sipping
his absinthe. &ldquo;Three other men and I were
taking turns by twos to watch a dead man.
It was a fancy of his mother&rsquo;s. Our time was
up, and the other watch hadn&rsquo;t come. So my
chap&mdash;the one who was watching with me, I
mean&mdash;went to fetch them. I didn&rsquo;t think I
should mind. But it was just like you say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I kept thinking: suppose it should
move&mdash;it was so like life. And if it did
move, of course it would have been because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
it <i>was</i> alive, and I ought to have been glad,
because the man was my friend. But all the
same, if it had moved I should have gone
mad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Edward; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just exactly
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vincent called for a second absinthe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But a dead body&rsquo;s different to wax-works,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand any one being
frightened of <i>them</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; The contempt in the
other&rsquo;s tone stung him. &ldquo;I bet you wouldn&rsquo;t
spend a night alone in that place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bet you five pounds I do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; said Edward briskly. &ldquo;At least,
I would if you&rsquo;d got five pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I have. I&rsquo;m simply rolling. I&rsquo;ve
sold my Dejanira, didn&rsquo;t you know? I shall
win your money, though, anyway. But <i>you</i>
couldn&rsquo;t do it, old man. I suppose you&rsquo;ll
never outgrow that childish scare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might shut up about that,&rdquo; said
Edward shortly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s nothing to be ashamed of; some
women are afraid of mice or spiders. I say,
does Rose know you&rsquo;re a coward?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vincent!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No offence, old boy. One may as well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
call a spade a spade. Of course, you&rsquo;ve got
tons of moral courage, and all that. But you
<i>are</i> afraid of the dark&mdash;and wax-works!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you trying to quarrel with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven in its mercy forbid; but I bet <i>you</i>
wouldn&rsquo;t spend a night in the Musée Grévin
and keep your senses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the stake?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make it, that if I do, you&rsquo;ll never speak
to Rose again&mdash;and what&rsquo;s more, that you&rsquo;ll
never speak to me,&rdquo; said Edward, white-hot,
knocking down a chair as he rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; said Vincent; &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ll never
do it. Keep your hair on. Besides, you&rsquo;re
off home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be back in ten days. I&rsquo;ll do it
then,&rdquo; said Edward, and was off before the
other could answer.</p>

<p>Then Vincent, left alone, sat still, and over
his third absinthe remembered how, before she
had known Edward, Rose had smiled on him;
more than on the others, he had thought.
He thought of her wide, lovely eyes, her
wild-rose cheeks, the scented curves of her
hair, and then and there the devil entered
into him.</p>

<p>In ten days Edward would undoubtedly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
try to win his wager. He would try to
spend the night in the Musée Grévin.
Perhaps something could be arranged before
that. If one knew the place thoroughly!
A little scare would serve Edward right for
being the man to whom that last glance of
Rose&rsquo;s had been given.</p>

<p>Vincent dined lightly, but with conscientious
care&mdash;and as he dined, he thought.
Something might be done by tying a string
to one of the figures, and making it move,
when Edward was going through that impossible
night among the effigies that are
so like life&mdash;so like death. Something that
was not the devil said: &ldquo;You may frighten
him out of his wits.&rdquo; And the devil
answered: &ldquo;Nonsense! do him good. He
oughtn&rsquo;t to be such a schoolgirl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anyway, the five pounds might as well
be won to-night as any other night. He
would take a great coat, sleep sound in the
place of horrors, and the people who opened
it in the morning to sweep and dust would
bear witness that he had passed the night
there. He thought he might trust to the
French love of a sporting wager to keep him
from any bother with the authorities.</p>

<p>So he went in among the crowd, and looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
about among the wax-works for a place to
hide in. He was not in the least afraid of
these lifeless images. He had always been
able to control his nervous tremors. He
was not even afraid of being frightened,
which, by the way, is the worst fear of all.
As one looks at the room of the poor little
Dauphin, one sees a door to the left. It
opens out of the room on to blackness.
There were few people in the gallery.
Vincent watched, and in a moment when
he was alone he stepped over the barrier
and through this door. A narrow passage
ran round behind the wall of the room.
Here he hid, and when the gallery was
deserted he looked out across the body of
little Capet to the gaolers at the window.
There was a soldier at the window, too.
Vincent amused himself with the fancy that
this soldier might walk round the passage
at the back of the room and tap him on
the shoulder in the darkness. Only the head
and shoulders of the soldier and the gaoler
showed, so, of course, they could not walk,
even if they were something that was not
wax-work.</p>

<p>Presently he himself went along the
passage and round to the window where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
they were. He found that they had legs.
They were full-sized figures dressed completely
in the costume of the period.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thorough the beggars are, even the parts
that don&rsquo;t show&mdash;artists, upon my word,&rdquo;
said Vincent, and went back to his doorway,
thinking of the hidden carving behind the
capitols of Gothic cathedrals.</p>

<p>But the idea of the soldier who might come
behind him in the dark stuck in his mind.
Though still a few visitors strolled through
the gallery, the closing hour was near. He
supposed it would be quite dark then. And
now he had allowed himself to be amused
by the thought of something that should
creep up behind him in the dark, he might
possibly be nervous in that passage round
which, if wax-works could move, the soldier
might have come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;one might easily
frighten oneself by just fancying things.
Suppose there were a back way from
Marat&rsquo;s bath-room, and instead of the
soldier Marat came out of his bath, with
his wet towels stained with blood, and
dabbed them against your neck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When next the gallery was empty he
crept out. Not because he was nervous,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
he told himself, but because one might be,
and because the passage was draughty, and
he meant to sleep.</p>

<p>He went down the steps into the Catacombs,
and here he spoke the truth to
himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hang it all!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I <i>was</i> nervous.
That fool Edward must have infected me.
Mesmeric influences, or something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chuck it and go home,&rdquo; said Commonsense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m damned if I do!&rdquo; said Vincent.</p>

<p>There were a good many people in the
Catacombs at the moment&mdash;live people.
He sucked confidence from their nearness,
and went up and down looking for a
hiding-place.</p>

<p>Through rock-hewn arches he saw a
burial scene&mdash;a corpse on a bier surrounded
by mourners; a great pillar cut off half the
still, lying figure. It was all still and
unemotional as a Sunday School oleograph.
He waited till no one was near, then
slipped quickly through the mourning group
and hid behind the pillar. Surprising&mdash;heartening
too&mdash;to find a plain rushed chair
there, doubtless set for the resting of tired
officials. He sat down in it, comforted his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
hand with the commonplace lines of its
rungs and back. A shrouded waxen figure
just behind him to the left of his pillar
worried him a little, but the corpse left
him unmoved as itself. A far better place
this than that draughty passage where the
soldier with legs kept intruding on the
darkness that is always behind one.</p>

<p>Custodians went along the passages
issuing orders. A stillness fell. Then
suddenly all the lights went out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Vincent, and
composed himself to sleep.</p>

<p>But he seemed to have forgotten what
sleep was like. He firmly fixed his thoughts
on pleasant things&mdash;the sale of his picture,
dances with Rose, merry evenings with
Edward and the others. But the thoughts
rushed by him like motes in sunbeams&mdash;he
could not hold a single one of them,
and presently it seemed that he had
thought of every pleasant thing that had
ever happened to him, and that now, if he
thought at all, he must think of the things
one wants most to forget. And there
would be time in this long night to think
much of many things. But now he found
that he could no longer think.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
The draped effigy just behind him worried
him again. He had been trying, at the
back of his mind, behind the other thoughts,
to strangle the thought of it. But it was
there&mdash;very close to him. Suppose it put
out its hand, its wax hand, and touched
him. But it was of wax: it could not
move. No, of course not. But suppose
it <i>did</i>?</p>

<p>He laughed aloud, a short, dry laugh that
echoed through the vaults. The cheering
effect of laughter has been over-estimated,
perhaps. Anyhow, he did not laugh again.</p>

<p>The silence was intense, but it was a
silence thick with rustlings and breathings,
and movements that his ear, strained to
the uttermost, could just not hear. Suppose,
as Edward had said, when all the lights were
out, these things did move. A corpse was
a thing that had moved&mdash;given a certain
condition&mdash;Life. What if there were a
condition, given which these things could
move? What if such conditions were
present now? What if all of them&mdash;Napoleon,
yellow-white from his death
sleep&mdash;the beasts from the Amphitheatre,
gore dribbling from their jaws&mdash;that soldier
with the legs&mdash;all were drawing near to him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
in this full silence? Those death masks
of Robespierre and Mirabeau, they might
float down through the darkness till they
touched his face. That head of Madame de
Lamballe on the pike might be thrust at
him from behind the pillar. The silence
throbbed with sounds that could not quite
be heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You fool,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;your dinner
has disagreed with you, with a vengeance.
Don&rsquo;t be an ass. The whole lot are only
a set of big dolls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He felt for his matches, and lighted a
cigarette. The gleam of the match fell on
the face of the corpse in front of him. The
light was brief, and it seemed, somehow,
impossible to look, by that light, in every
corner where one would have wished to look.
The match burnt his fingers as it went out;
and there were only three more matches in
the box.</p>

<p>It was dark again, and the image left on
the darkness was that of the corpse in front
of him. He thought of his dead friend.
When the cigarette was smoked out, he
thought of him more and more, till it
seemed that what lay on the bier was not
wax. His hand reached forward, and drew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
back more than once. But at last he made
it touch the bier, and through the blackness
travel up along a lean, rigid arm to the wax
face that lay there so still. The touch was
not reassuring. Just so, and not otherwise,
had his dead friend&rsquo;s face felt, to the last
touch of his lips: cold, firm, waxen. People
always said the dead were &ldquo;waxen.&rdquo; How
true that was! He had never thought of
it before. He thought of it now.</p>

<p>He sat still, so still that every muscle
ached, because if you wish to hear the sounds
that infest silence, you must be very still
indeed. He thought of Edward, and of the
string he had meant to tie to one of the
figures.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t be needed,&rdquo; he told himself.
And his ears ached with listening&mdash;listening
for the sound that, it seemed, <i>must</i>
break at last from that crowded silence.</p>

<p>He never knew how long he sat there.
To move, to go up, to batter at the door
and clamour to be let out&mdash;that one could
have done if one had had a lantern, or even
a full matchbox. But in the dark, not
knowing the turnings, to feel one&rsquo;s way
among these things that were so like life
and yet were not alive&mdash;to touch, perhaps,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
these faces that were not dead, and yet felt
like death. His heart beat heavily in his
throat at the thought.</p>

<p>No, he must sit still till morning. He
had been hypnotised into this state, he told
himself, by Edward, no doubt; it was not
natural to him.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the silence was shattered.
In the dark something moved. And, after
those sounds that the silence teemed with,
the noise seemed to him thunder-loud.
Yet it was only a very, very little sound,
just the rustling of drapery, as though something
had turned in its sleep. And there
was a sigh&mdash;not far off.</p>

<p>Vincent&rsquo;s muscles and tendons tightened
like fine-drawn wire. He listened. There
was nothing more: only the silence, the
thick silence.</p>

<p>The sound had seemed to come from a
part of the vault where, long ago, when
there was light, he had seen a grave being
dug for the body of a young girl martyr.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will get up and go out,&rdquo; said Vincent.
&ldquo;I have three matches. I am off my head.
I shall really be nervous presently if I don&rsquo;t
look out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He got up and struck a match, refused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
his eyes the sight of the corpse whose waxen
face he had felt in the blackness, and made
his way through the crowd of figures. By
the match&rsquo;s flicker they seemed to make way
for him, to turn their heads to look after
him. The match lasted till he got to a turn
of the rock-hewn passage. His next match
showed him the burial scene: the little, thin
body of the martyr, palm in hand, lying
on the rock floor in patient waiting, the
grave-digger, the mourners. Some standing,
some kneeling, one crouched on the ground.</p>

<p>This was where that sound had come from,
that rustle, that sigh. He had thought he
was going away from it: instead, he had
come straight to the spot where, if anywhere,
his nerves might be expected to play him
false.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; he said, and he said it aloud, &ldquo;the
silly things are only wax. Who&rsquo;s afraid?&rdquo;
His voice sounded loud in the silence that
lives with the wax people. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re only
wax,&rdquo; he said again, and touched with his
foot, contemptuously, the crouching figure in
the mantle.</p>

<p>And, as he touched it, it raised its head
and looked vacantly at him, and its eyes
were mobile and alive. He staggered back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
against another figure, and dropped the
match. In the new darkness he heard the
crouching figure move towards him. Then
the darkness fitted in round him very closely.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>&ldquo;What was it exactly that sent poor
Vincent mad: you&rsquo;ve never told me?&rdquo; Rose
asked the question. She and Edward were
looking out over the pines and tamarisks,
across the blue Mediterranean. They were
very happy, because it was their honeymoon.</p>

<p>He told her about the Musée Grévin and
the wager, but he did not state the terms
of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why did he think you would be
afraid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He told her why.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then what happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I suppose he thought there was
no time like the present&mdash;for his five pounds,
you know&mdash;and he hid among the wax-works.
And I missed my train, and <i>I</i> thought there
was no time like the present. In fact, dear,
I thought if I waited I should have time to
make certain of funking it, so I hid there,
too. And I put on my big black capuchon,
and sat down right in one of the wax-work
groups&mdash;they couldn&rsquo;t see me from the passage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
where you walk. And after they put the lights
out I simply went to sleep; and I woke up&mdash;and
there was a light, and I heard some one
say: &lsquo;They&rsquo;re only wax,&rsquo; and it was Vincent.
He thought I was one of the wax people,
till I looked at him; and I expect he thought
I was one of them even then, poor chap.
And his match went out, and while I was
trying to find my railway reading-lamp that
I&rsquo;d got near me, he began to scream, and
the night watchman came running. And
now he thinks every one in the asylum is
made of wax, and he screams if they come
near him. They have to put his food beside
him while he&rsquo;s asleep. It&rsquo;s horrible. I can&rsquo;t
help feeling as if it were my fault, somehow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; said Rose. &ldquo;Poor
Vincent! Do you know I never <i>really</i> liked
him.&rdquo; There was a pause. Then she said:
&ldquo;But how was it <i>you</i> weren&rsquo;t frightened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;horribly frightened. I&mdash;I&mdash;it
sounds idiotic, but I thought I should
go mad at first&mdash;I did really: and yet I
<i>had</i> to go through with it. And then I got
among the figures of the people in the Catacombs,
the people who died for&mdash;for things,
don&rsquo;t you know, died in such horrible ways.
And there they were, so calm&mdash;and believing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
it was all all right. And I thought about
what they&rsquo;d gone through. It sounds awful
rot I know, dear&mdash;but I expect I was
sleepy. Those wax people, they sort of
seemed as if they were alive, and were
telling me there wasn&rsquo;t anything to be
frightened about. I felt as if I were one
of them, and they were all my friends, and
they&rsquo;d wake me if anything went wrong,
so I just went to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I understand,&rdquo; she said. But
she didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the odd thing is,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
never been afraid of the dark since. Perhaps
his calling me a coward had something to
do with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; said she. And she
was right. But she would never have understood
how, nor why.</p>

<h2 class="padtop smlpadb">III<br />
<br />
THE STRANGER WHO MIGHT HAVE
BEEN OBSERVED</h2>


<p>&ldquo;There he goes&mdash;isn&rsquo;t he simply detestable!&rdquo;
She spoke suddenly, after a silence longer
than was usual to her; she was tired, and
her voice was a note or two above its
habitual key. She blushed, a deep pink
blush of intense annoyance, as the young
man passed down the long platform among
the crowd of city men and typewriting girls,
patiently waiting for the belated train to
allow them to go home from work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, do you think he heard? Oh, Molly&mdash;I
believe he did!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Molly briskly, &ldquo;of course
he didn&rsquo;t. And I must say I don&rsquo;t think
he&rsquo;s so bad. If he didn&rsquo;t look so sulky he
wouldn&rsquo;t be <i>half</i> bad, really. If his eyebrows
weren&rsquo;t tied up into knots, I believe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
he&rsquo;d look quite too frightfully sweet for
anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s exactly like that Polish model we
had last week. Oh, Molly, he&rsquo;s coming back
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again he passed the two girls. His
expression was certainly not amiable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long have you known him?&rdquo; Molly
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> know him. I tell you I only see
him on the platform at Mill Vale. He and
I seem to be the only people&mdash;the only
decent people&mdash;who&rsquo;ve found out the new
station. He goes up by the 9.1 every day,
and so do I. And the train&rsquo;s always late, so
we have the platform and the booking office
to ourselves. And there we sit, or stand,
or walk, morning after morning like two
stuck pigs in a trough of silence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t jumble your metaphors, though
you very nearly carried it off with the
trough, I own. Stuck pigs don&rsquo;t walk&mdash;in
troughs, or anywhere else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you know what I mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what do you want the wretched man
to do? He can&rsquo;t speak to you: it wouldn&rsquo;t
be proper&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Proper&mdash;why not? We&rsquo;re human beings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
not wild beasts. At least, I&rsquo;m a human
being.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s a beast&mdash;I see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I were a man,&rdquo; said Nina. &ldquo;There
he is again. His nose goes up another half
inch every time he passes me. What&rsquo;s he got
to be so superior about? If I were a man
I&rsquo;d certainly pass the time of day with a
fellow-creature if I were condemned to spend
from ten to forty minutes with it six days
out of the seven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I expect he&rsquo;s afraid you&rsquo;d want to marry
him. My brother Cecil says men are always
horribly frightened about that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your brother Cecil!&rdquo; said Nina scornfully.
&ldquo;Yes; that&rsquo;s just the sort of thing
anybody&rsquo;s brother Cecil <i>would</i> say. He
simply looks down on me because I go
third. He only goes second himself, too.
Here&rsquo;s the train&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two Art students climbed into their
third-class carriage, and their talk, leaving
Nina&rsquo;s fellow-traveller, washed like a babbling
brook about the feet of great rocks, busied
itself with the old Italian Masters, painting
as a mission, and the aims of Art&mdash;presently
running through flatter country and lapping
round perspective, foreshortening, tones, values
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
high lights and the preposterous lisp of the
anatomy lecturer.</p>

<p>Arrived at Mill Vale the Slade students
jumped from their carriage to meet a wind
that swept grey curtains of rain across the
bleak length of the platform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we haven&rsquo;t so much as a rib of an
umbrella between us,&rdquo; sighed Molly, putting
her white handkerchief over the &ldquo;best&rdquo; hat
which signalised her Saturday to Monday
with her friend. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right: that man is
a pig. There he goes with an umbrella big
enough for all three of us. Oh, it&rsquo;s too bad!
He&rsquo;s putting it down&mdash;he&rsquo;s running. He
runs rather well. He&rsquo;s exactly like the cast
of the Discobolus in the Antique Room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only his manners have not that repose
that stamps the cast. Come on&mdash;don&rsquo;t stand
staring after him like that. We&rsquo;d better run,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll think we&rsquo;re running after him. Oh,
bother&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A moment of indecision, and Nina had
turned her skirt over her head, and the two
ran home to the little rooms where Nina
lived&mdash;in the house of an old servant. Nina
had no world of relations&mdash;she was alone.
In the world of Art she had many friends,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
and in the world of Art she meant to make
her mark. For the present she was content
to make the tea, and then to set feet on the
fender for a cosy evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see him coming out of church?&rdquo;
Nina asked next day. &ldquo;He looked sulkier
than ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think why you bother about him,&rdquo;
said the other girl. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not really interesting.
What do you call him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, everything has a name, even a
pudding. <i>I</i> made a name for him at once.
It is &lsquo;the stranger who might have been
observed&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>They laughed. After the early dinner they
went for a walk. None of your strolls, but
a good steady eight miles. Coming home,
they met the stranger: and then they
talked about him again. For, fair reader,
I cannot conceal from you that there are
many girls who do think and talk about
young men, even when they have not been
introduced to them. Not really nice girls
like yourself, fair reader&mdash;but ordinary,
commonplace girls who have not your
delicate natures, and who really do sometimes
experience a fleeting sensation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
interest even in the people whose names
they don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>Next morning they saw him at the
station. The 9.1 took the bit in its teeth,
and instead of being, as usual, the 9.30
something, became merely the 9.23. So for
some twenty odd minutes the stranger not
only might have been, but was, observed
by four bright and critical eyes. I don&rsquo;t
mean that my girls stared, of course.
Perhaps you do not know that there are
ways of observing strangers other than by
the stare direct. He looked sulkier than
ever: but he also had eyes. Yet he, too,
was far from staring, so far that the
indignant Nina broke out in a distracted
whisper: &ldquo;There! you see! I&rsquo;m not important
enough for him even to perceive
my existence. I&rsquo;m always expecting him
to walk on me. I wonder whether he&rsquo;d
apologise when he found I wasn&rsquo;t the
station door-mat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stranger shrugged his shoulders all to
himself in his second-class carriage when the
train had started.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Simply detestable!&rsquo; But how one talks
prose without knowing it, all along the line!
How can I ever have come enough into her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
line of vision to be distinguished by an epithet!
And why this one? Detestable!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The epithet, however distinguishing, seemed
somehow to lack charm.</p>

<p>At Cannon Street Station the stranger
looked sulkier than Nina had ever seen him.
She said so, adding: &ldquo;Than I&rsquo;ve ever seen
him? Oh&mdash;I&rsquo;m wandering. He looks sulkier
than I&rsquo;vsquo;ve ever seen any one&mdash;sulkier than I&rsquo;ve
ever dreamed possible. Pig&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Through the week, painting at the school
and black and white work in the evenings
filled Nina&rsquo;s mind to the exclusion even of
strangers who might, in more leisured
moments, seem worthy of observation. She
was aware of the sulky one on platforms, of
course, but talking about him to Molly was
more amusing somehow than merely thinking
of him. When it came to thinking, the real,
the earnest things of life&mdash;the Sketch Club,
the chance of the Melville Nettleship Prize,
the intricate hideousness of bones and muscles&mdash;took
the field and kept it, against strangers
and acquaintances alike.</p>

<p>Saturday, turning this week&rsquo;s scribbled page
to the fair, clear page of next week, brought
the stranger back to her thoughts, and to
eyes now not obscured by close realities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
He passed her on the platform, with a
dozen bunches of violets in his hands.</p>

<p>Outside, on the railway bridge, the red
and green lamps glowed dully through deep
floods of yellow fog. The platform was
crowded, the train late. When at last it
steamed slowly in, the crowd surged towards
it. The third-class carriages were filled in the
moment. Nina hurried along the platform
peering into the second-class carriages. Full
also.</p>

<p>Then the guard opened the way for her
into the blue-cloth Paradise of a first-class
carriage; and, just as the train gave the
shudder of disgust which heralds its shame-faced
reluctant departure, the door opened
again, and the guard pushed in another
traveller&mdash;the &ldquo;stranger who might&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; of
course. The door banged, the train moved off
with an air of brisk determination. A hundred
yards from the platform it stopped dead.</p>

<p>There were no other travellers in that
carriage. When the train had stood still for
ten minutes or so, the stranger got up and
put his head out of the window. At that
instant the train decided to move again. It
did it suddenly, and, exhausted by the effort,
stopped after half a dozen yards&rsquo; progress with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
so powerful a turn of the brake that the
stranger was flung sideways against Nina, and
his elbow nearly knocked her hat off.</p>

<p>He raised his own apologetically&mdash;but he
did not speak even then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wretch!&rdquo; said Nina hotly; &ldquo;he might
at least have begged my pardon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stranger sat down again, and began
to read the <i>Spectator</i>. Nina had no papers.
The train moved on an inch or two, and the
reddening yellow of the fog seemed like a
Charity blanket pressed against each window.
Three of the bunches of violets shook and
vibrated and slipped, the train moved again
and they fell on the floor of the carriage.
Nina watched their trembling in an agony
of irritation induced by the fog, the delay,
and the persistent silence of her companion.
When the flowers fell, she spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve dropped your flowers,&rdquo; she said.
Again a bow, a silent bow, and the flowers
were picked up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m desperate!&rdquo; Nina said inwardly.
&ldquo;He must be mad&mdash;or dumb&mdash;or have a
vow of silence&mdash;I wonder which?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The train had not yet reached the next
station, though it had left the last nearly
an hour before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
&ldquo;Which is it? Mad, dumb, or a monk? I
<i>will</i> find out. Well, it&rsquo;s his own fault; he
shouldn&rsquo;t be so aggravating. I&rsquo;m going to
speak to him. I&rsquo;ve made up my mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the interval between decision and action
the train in a sudden brief access of nervous
energy got itself through a station, and
paused a furlong down the line exhausted
by the effort.</p>

<p>The stranger had put down his <i>Spectator</i>
and was gazing gloomily out at the fog.</p>

<p>Nina drew a deep breath, and said&mdash;at
least she nearly said: &ldquo;What a dreadful fog!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she stopped. That seemed a dull
beginning. If she said that he would think
she was commonplace, and she had that
sustaining inward consciousness, mercifully
vouchsafed even to the dullest of us, of being
really rather nice, and not commonplace at
all. But what should she say? If she said
anything about the colour of the fog and
Turner or Whistler, it might be telling, but
it would be of the shop shoppy. If she began
about books&mdash;the <i>Spectator</i> suggested this&mdash;she
would stand as a prig confessed. If she
spoke of politics she would be an ignorant impostor
soon exposed. If&mdash;&mdash;But Nina took
out her watch and resolved: &ldquo;When the little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
hand gets to the quarter I <i>will</i> speak. Whatever
I say, I&rsquo;ll say something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And when the big hand did get to the
quarter Nina did speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t we talk?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>He looked at her; and he seemed to be
struggling silently with some emotion too
deep for words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so silly to sit here like mutes,&rdquo; Nina
went on hurriedly&mdash;a little frightened, now
she had begun, but more than a little
determined not to be frightened. &ldquo;If we
were at a dance we shouldn&rsquo;t know any
more of each other than we do now&mdash;and
you&rsquo;d have to talk then. Why shouldn&rsquo;t we
now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the stranger spoke, and at the first
sentence Nina understood exactly what reason
had decided the stranger that they should not
talk. Yet now they did. If this were a work
of fiction I shouldn&rsquo;t dare to pretend that the
train took more than two hours to get to Mill
Vale. But in a plain record of fact one must
speak the truth. The train took exactly two
hours and fifty minutes to cover the eleven
miles between London and Mill Vale. After
that first question and reply Nina and the
stranger talked the whole way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
He walked with her to the door of her
lodging, and she offered him her hand
without that moment of hesitation which
would have been natural to any heroine,
because she had debated the question of
that handshake all the way from the station,
and made up her mind just as they reached
the church, a stone&rsquo;s throw from her home.
When the door closed on her he went slowly
back to the churchyard to lay his violets on
a grave. Nina saw them there next day
when she came out of church. She saw him
too, and gave him a bow and a very small
smile, and turned away quickly. The bow
meant: &ldquo;You see I&rsquo;m not going to speak
to you. You mustn&rsquo;t think I want to be
always talking to you.&rdquo; The smile meant:
&ldquo;But you mustn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m cross. I&rsquo;m
not&mdash;only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the hot, stuffy &ldquo;life-room&rdquo; at the Slade
next day Molly teased with ill-judged bread-crumbs
an arm hopelessly ill drawn, and
chattered softly to Nina, who in the Saturday
solitude had drawn her easel behind her
friend&rsquo;s &ldquo;donkey.&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well here
when you first come in, but when once you
<i>are</i> warm, oh dear, how warm you are!
Why do models want such boiling rooms?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
Why can&rsquo;t they be soaked in alum or myrrh
or something to harden their silly skins so
that they won&rsquo;t mind a breath of decent air?
And I believe the model&rsquo;s deformed&mdash;she
certainly is from where I am. Oh, look at
my arm! I ask you a little&mdash;look at the
beastly thing. Foreshortened like this it
looks like a fillet of veal with a pound of
sausages tied on to it for a hand. Oh, my
own and only Nina&mdash;save the sinking
ship!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ought to go more like <i>that</i>,&rdquo; Nina
said with indicative brush, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t keep
on rubbing out so fiercely. You&rsquo;ll get
paralysed with bread&mdash;it&rsquo;s a disease, you
know. I heard Tonks telling you so only
the other day&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather a good phrase: I wonder
where he got it? He was rather nice that
day,&rdquo; said Molly. &ldquo;Oh, this arm! It&rsquo;s no
good&mdash;I believe the model&rsquo;s moved&mdash;I tell
you I <i>must</i>.&rdquo; More bread. Nina re-absorbed
in her canvas. &ldquo;Yours is coming
well. What&rsquo;s the matter with you to-day?
You&rsquo;re very mousy. Has the &lsquo;stranger who
might&rsquo; been scowling more than usual?
Or have you got a headache? I&rsquo;m sure
this atmosphere&rsquo;s enough to make you.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
Did you see him this morning? Have
you fainted at his feet yet? Has he
relented in the matter of umbrellas? I&rsquo;m
sure he can&rsquo;t have passed the whole week
without some act of grumpiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nina leaned back and looked through half-shut
eyes at the model&rsquo;s beautiful form and
stupid face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went down in the same carriage with
him on Thursday,&rdquo; she said slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did? Did he rush into the third
class, where angels like himself ought to
fear to tread?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a fog. Thirds all full, and
seconds too. The guard bundled us both
in, and the train started&mdash;and it took
three or four hours to get down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any one else in the carriage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so much as a mouse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What <i>did</i> you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do? What could I do? We sat in
opposite corners as far as we could get from
each other, exchanging occasional glances of
mutual detestation for about an hour and
a half. He knocked me down and walked
on me once, and took his hat off very politely
and beg-pardoningly, but he never said a
word. He didn&rsquo;t even say he thought I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
was the door-mat. And then some cabbages
of his fell off the seat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure they weren&rsquo;t thistles?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vegetables of some sort. And I said:
&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve dropped your&mdash;&mdash;whatever they
were.&rsquo; And he just bowed again in a
thank-you-very-much-but-I&rsquo;m-sure-I-don&rsquo;t-know-what-business-it-is-of-yours
sort of way. Do leave that bread alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly, lost in the interest of the recital,
was crumbling the bread as though the floor
of the life-room were the natural haunt of
doves and sparrows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Nina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why ever didn&rsquo;t you ask him to put
the window up, or down, or something? I
would have&mdash;just to hear if he has a voice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t have been any good. He&rsquo;d
just have bowed again, and I&rsquo;d had enough
bows to last a long time. No: I just said
straight out that we were a couple of idiots
to sit there gaping at each other with our
tongues out, and why on earth shouldn&rsquo;t
we talk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never did!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or words to that effect, anyhow. And
then he said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
A long pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He told me why he never spoke to
strangers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a slap in the face! You poor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he didn&rsquo;t say it like <i>that</i>, you silly
idiot. And it was quite a good reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me exactly what he said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; At any rate, I&rsquo;m
satisfied, and I rather wish we hadn&rsquo;t called
him pigs and beasts, and things like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to tell me the reason?
Oh, very well&mdash;you leave it to my guessing?
Of course it&rsquo;s quite evident he&rsquo;s hopelessly
in love with you, and never ventured to
speak for fear of betraying his passion. But,
encouraged by your advances&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly, go on with that arm, and don&rsquo;t
be a vulgar little donkey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly obeyed. Presently: &ldquo;Cross-patch,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; said Nina, &ldquo;but I want to work,
and I like you best when you&rsquo;re not vulgar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very rude.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
&ldquo;No: only candid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly&rsquo;s wounded pride, besieged by her
curiosity, held out for five minutes. Then:
&ldquo;Did you talk to him much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the way down?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he nice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he clever?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what I want to know is, and
then I&rsquo;ll let you alone&mdash;what did you talk
about? Tell me that, and I won&rsquo;t ask
another question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We talked,&rdquo; said Nina deliberately,
taking a clean brush, &ldquo;we talked about
your brother Cecil. No, I shan&rsquo;t tell you
what we said, or why we talked about him,
or anything. You&rsquo;ve had your one question,
now shut up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nina,&rdquo; said Molly calmly, &ldquo;if I didn&rsquo;t like
you so much I should hate you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That certainty about the other has always
been the foundation of our mutual regard,&rdquo;
said Nina calmly.</p>

<p>Then they laughed, and began to work in
earnest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
The next time Molly mentioned the
&ldquo;stranger who might have been observed&rdquo;
Nina laughed, and said: &ldquo;The subject is
forbidden; it makes you vulgar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you disagreeable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s best to avoid it. Best for you
and best for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But do you ever see him now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On occasion. He still travels by the 9.1,
and I still have the use of my eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does he ever talk to you like he did that
Thursday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;never. And I&rsquo;m not going to talk
about him to you, so it&rsquo;s no good. Your
turn to choose a subject. You won&rsquo;t? Then
it becomes my turn. What a long winter
this is! We seem to have taken years to get
from November to February!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The time went more quickly between
February and May. It was when the
country was wearing its full dress of green
and the hawthorn pearls were opening into
baby-roses in the hedgerows that it was
Nina&rsquo;s fortune to be put, by the zealous
indiscretion of a mistaken porter, into an
express train for Beechwood&mdash;the wrong
station&mdash;the wrong line.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;stranger who might have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
observed,&rdquo; on this occasion was not observed,
but observer. He saw and recognised the
porter&rsquo;s error, hesitated a moment, and then
leaped into a carriage just behind hers. So
that when, after a swift journey made eventful
by agonised recognition of the fleeting faces
of various stations where she might have
changed and caught her own train, Nina
reached Beechwood, the stranger&rsquo;s hand was
ready to open the door for her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no train for ages,&rdquo; he said in tones
deliberate, almost hesitating. &ldquo;Shall we walk
home? It&rsquo;s only six miles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&mdash;aren&rsquo;t you going somewhere
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;I saw the porter put you in&mdash;and
I thought&mdash;at least&mdash;anyway you will
walk, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They walked. When they reached Beechwood
Common, he said: &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you take
my arm?&rdquo; And she took it. Her hands
were ungloved; the other hand was full of
silver may and bluebells. The sun shot level
shafts of gold between the birch trees across
the furze and heather.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How beautiful it is!&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve known each other three months,&rdquo;
said he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve seen you every day, and we&rsquo;ve
talked for hours and hours in those everlasting
trains,&rdquo; she said, as if in excuse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen you every day for longer than
that; the first time was on the 3rd of
October.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fancy remembering that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a good memory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A silence.</p>

<p>Nina broke it, to say again: &ldquo;How pretty!&rdquo;
She knew she had said it before, or something
like it, but she could think of nothing else&mdash;and
she wanted to say something.</p>

<p>He put his hand over hers as it lay on his
arm. She looked up at him quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said, stopping to look down into
her eyes and tightening his clasp on her hand.
&ldquo;Are you sorry you came to Beechwood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then be glad. My dear, I wish you
could ever be as glad as I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they walked on, still with his hand
on hers.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Nina and Molly sat on a locker swinging
their feet and eating their lunch in the Slade
corridor next day. Nina was humming
softly under her breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
&ldquo;What are you so happy for all of a
sudden?&rdquo; Molly asked. &ldquo;Your sketch-club
things are the worst I&rsquo;ve ever seen, and the
Professor was down on you like a hundred
of bricks this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not happy,&rdquo; said Nina, turning away
what seemed to Molly a new face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing. Oh yes&mdash;by the way, I&rsquo;m
going to be married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not <i>really</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Check this unflattering display of
incredulity&mdash;I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really and truly? And you never told
me a thing. I hate slyness and secretiveness.
Nina, who is it? Do I know him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nina named a name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never even heard of him. But where
did you meet him? It really is rather deceitful
of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always meant to tell you, only there
was nothing to tell till yesterday except&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Except everything,&rdquo; said Molly. &ldquo;Well,
tell me now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nina jumped up and shook the bath-bun
crumbs off her green muslin pinafore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Promise not to be horrid, and I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t&mdash;I promise I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s him&mdash;the &lsquo;stranger who
might&rsquo;&mdash;you know. And I really should
have told you, though there wasn&rsquo;t anything
to tell, only&mdash;don&rsquo;t laugh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not. Can&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;m not? Only
what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, when I spoke to him that day in
the train, I said, &lsquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t we
talk?&rsquo; And he said, &lsquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;be&mdash;be&mdash;be&mdash;because
I stammer so.&rsquo; And he <i>did</i>.
You never heard anything like it. It was
awful. He took hours to get out those few
words, and I didn&rsquo;t know where to look.
And I felt such a brute because of the things
we&rsquo;d said about him, that I had no sense
left; and I told him straight out how I&rsquo;d
wondered he never even said he wondered how
late the train was when we were waiting for
the 9.1, and I was glad it was stammering
and not disagreeableness. And then I said
I wasn&rsquo;t glad he stammered, but so sorry;
and he was awfully nice about it, and I told
him about that man who cured your brother
Cecil of stammering, and he went to him at
once: and he&rsquo;s almost all right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; said Molly. &ldquo;Are you
sure&mdash;but why didn&rsquo;t he get cured long ago?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had a mother: she stammered frightfully&mdash;after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
the shock of his father&rsquo;s death,
or something, and he got into the way of it
from her. And&mdash;anyway he didn&rsquo;t. I think
it was so as not to hurt his mother&rsquo;s feelings,
or something. I don&rsquo;t quite understand.
And he said it didn&rsquo;t seem to matter when
she was dead. And he&rsquo;s an artist. He sells
his pictures too, and he teaches. He has a
studio in Chelsea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It all sounds a little thin; but if you&rsquo;re
pleased, I&rsquo;m sure I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Nina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what did he say when he asked you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t ask me,&rdquo; said Nina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But surely he said he&rsquo;d loved you since
the first moment he saw you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nina had to admit it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you see I wasn&rsquo;t such a vulgar little
donkey after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you were. You hadn&rsquo;t any business
even to <i>think</i> such things, much less say them.
Why, even <i>I</i> didn&rsquo;t dare to think it for&mdash;oh&mdash;for
ever so long. But I&rsquo;ll forgive it&mdash;and
if it&rsquo;s good it shall be a pretty little
bridesmaid, it shall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When is it to be?&rdquo; asked Molly, still
adrift in a sea of wonder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, quite soon, he says. He says we&rsquo;re
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
only wasting time by waiting. You see we&rsquo;re
both alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Molly, looking wistfully at her friend&rsquo;s
transfigured face, perceived sadly that it was
she who was alone, not they.</p>

<p>And the thought of the red-haired Pierrot
with whom she had danced nine times at the
Students&rsquo; Fancy Dress dance, an indiscretion
hitherto her dearest memory, now offered no
solid consolation.</p>

<p>Nina went away, singing softly under her
breath. Molly sighed and followed slowly.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="padtop smlpadb">IV<br />
<br />
RACK AND THUMBSCREW</h2>


<p>Her eyelids were red and swollen, her brown
hair, flattened out of its pretty curves, clung
closely to her head. Ink stained her hands,
and there was even a bluish smear of it on
her wrist. A tray with tea-things stood
among the litter of manuscript on her table.
The tea-pot had only cold tea-leaves in it;
the bread and butter was untouched.</p>

<p>She put down the pen, and went to the
window. The rose-tint of the sunset was
reflected on the bank of mist and smoke
beyond the river. Above, where the sky was
pale and clear, a star or two twinkled contentedly.</p>

<p>She stamped her foot.</p>

<p>Already the beautiful garments of the
evening mist, with veiled lights in the folds
of it, was embroidered sparsely with the early
litten lamps of impatient workers, and as she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
gazed, the embroidery was enriched by more
and more yellow and white and orange&mdash;the
string of jewels along the embankment, the
face of the church clock.</p>

<p>She turned from the window to the room,
and lighted her own lamp, for the room was
now deeply dusk. It was a large, low, pleasant
room. It had always seemed pleasant to her
through the five years in which she had
worked, and played, and laughed, and cried
there. Now she wondered why she had not
always hated it.</p>

<p>The stairs creaked. The knocker spoke.
She caught her head in both hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;this is too much!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet she went to the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;it&rsquo;s only you,&rdquo; she said, and, with no
other greeting, walked back into the room, and
sat down at the table.</p>

<p>The newcomer was left to close the outer
door, and to follow at her own pleasure. The
newcomer was another girl, younger, prettier,
smarter. She turned her head sidewise, like
a little bird, and looked at her friend with
very bright eyes. Then she looked round
the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Jane,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;whatever have
you been doing to yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said her dear Jane very sulkily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, if genius burns&mdash;your stairs are
devilish&mdash;but if you&rsquo;d rather I went
away&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t go, Milly. I&rsquo;m perfectly mad.&rdquo;
She jumped up and waved her outstretched
arms over the mass of papers on the table.
&ldquo;Look at all this&mdash;three days&rsquo; work&mdash;rot&mdash;abject
rot! I wish I was dead. I
was wondering just now whether it would
hurt much if one leaned too far out of the
window&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash; No, I didn&rsquo;t do it&mdash;as
you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked the other
prosaically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing. That&rsquo;s just it. I&rsquo;m perfectly
well&mdash;at least I was&mdash;only now I&rsquo;m all
trembly with drink.&rdquo; She pointed to the
tea-cups. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the chance of my life, and
I can&rsquo;t take it. I can&rsquo;t work: my brain&rsquo;s
like batter. And everything depends on my
idiot brain&mdash;it has done for these five years.
That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so awful. It all depends on
me&mdash;and I&rsquo;m going all to pieces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you so!&rdquo; rejoined the other.
&ldquo;You would stay in town all the summer
and autumn, slaving away. I knew you&rsquo;d
break down, and now you&rsquo;ve done it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve slaved for five years, and I&rsquo;ve never
broken down before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you have now. Go away at once.
Take a holiday. You&rsquo;ll work like Shakespeare
and Michelangelo after it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I <i>can&rsquo;t</i>&mdash;that&rsquo;s just it. It&rsquo;s those
stories for the <i>Monthly Multitude</i>; I&rsquo;m doing
a series. I&rsquo;m behind <i>now</i>: and if I don&rsquo;t
get it done this week, they&rsquo;ll stop the series.
It&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been working for all these
years. It&rsquo;s the best chance I&rsquo;ve ever had,
and it&rsquo;s come <i>now</i>, when I can&rsquo;t do it.
Your father&rsquo;s a doctor: isn&rsquo;t there any
medicine you can take to make your head
more like a head and less like a suet
pudding?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Milly, &ldquo;I really came
in to ask you to come away with us at
Whitsuntide; but you ought to go away
<i>now</i>. Just go to our cottage at Lymchurch.
There&rsquo;s a dear old girl in the village&mdash;Mrs
Beale&mdash;she&rsquo;ll look after you. It&rsquo;s a glorious
place for work. Father did reams down there.
You&rsquo;ll do your stuff there right enough.
This is only Monday. Go to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he? I will. Oh yes, I will. I&rsquo;ll
go to-night, if there&rsquo;s a train.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t, my dear lunatic. You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
are now going to wash your face and do
your hair, and take me out to dinner&mdash;a
real eighteenpenny dinner at Roches. I&rsquo;ll
stand treat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was after dinner, as the two girls waited
for Milly&rsquo;s omnibus, that the word of the
evening was spoken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do hope you&rsquo;ll have a good quiet time,&rdquo;
Milly said; &ldquo;and it really is a good place
for work. Poor Edgar did a lot of work
there last year. There&rsquo;s a cabinet with a
secret drawer that he said inspired him with
mysterious tales, and&mdash;&mdash; There&rsquo;s my &rsquo;bus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you say <i>poor</i> Edgar?&rdquo; Jane
asked, smiling lightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, hadn&rsquo;t you heard? Awfully sad
thing. He sailed from New York a fortnight
ago. No news of the ship. His mother&rsquo;s
in mourning. I saw her yesterday. Quite
broken down. Good-bye. <i>Do</i> take care of
yourself, and get well and jolly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jane stood long staring after the swaying
bulk of the omnibus, then she drew a deep
breath and went home.</p>

<p>Edgar was dead. What a brute Milly was!
But, of course, Edgar was nothing to Milly&mdash;nothing
but a pleasant friend. How slowly
people walked in the streets! Jane walked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
quickly&mdash;so quickly that more than one
jostled foot-passenger stopped to stare after
her.</p>

<p>She had known that he was coming home&mdash;and
when. She had not owned to herself
that the constant intrusion of that thought,
&ldquo;He is here&mdash;in London,&rdquo; the wonder as to
when and how she should see him again, had
counted for very much in these last days of
fierce effort and resented defeat.</p>

<p>She got back to her rooms. She remembers
letting herself in with her key. She remembers
that some time during the night
she destroyed all those futile beginnings of
stories. Also, that she found herself saying
over and over again, and very loud: &ldquo;There
are the boys&mdash;you know there are the boys.&rdquo;
Because, when you have two little brothers
to keep, you must not allow yourself to
forget it.</p>

<p>But for the rest she remembers little distinctly.
Only she is sure that she did not
cry, and that she did not sleep.</p>

<p>In the morning she found her rooms very
tidy and her box packed. She had put in
the boys&rsquo; portraits, because one must always
remember the boys.</p>

<p>She got a cab and she caught a train, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
she reached the seaside cottage. Its little
windows blinked firelit welcome to her, as
she blundered almost blindly out of the
station fly and up the narrow path edged
with sea-shells.</p>

<p>Milly had telegraphed. Mrs Beale was
there, tremulous, kindly, effective; with armchairs
wheeled to the April fire&mdash;cups of tea,
timid, gentle solicitude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My word, Miss, but you do look done
up,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;The kettle&rsquo;s just on the boil,
and I&rsquo;ll wet you a cup o&rsquo; tea this instant
minute, and I&rsquo;ve a perfect picture of a chick
a-roastin&rsquo; ready for your bit o&rsquo; dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jane leaned back in the cushioned chair
and looked round the quiet, pleasant little
room. For the moment it seemed good to
have a new place to be unhappy in.</p>

<p>But afterwards, when Mrs Beale had gone
and she was alone in the house, there was
time to think&mdash;all the time there had ever
been since the world began&mdash;all the time
that there would ever be till the world ended.
Of that night, too, Jane cannot remember
everything; but she knows that she did not
sleep, and that her eyes were dry: very dry
and burning, as though they had been licked
into place between their lids by a tongue of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
flame. It was a long night: a spacious night,
with room in it for more memories of Edgar
than she had known herself mistress of.</p>

<p>Edgar, truculent schoolboy; Edgar at
Oxford, superior to the point of the intolerable;
Edgar journalist, novelist, war correspondent&mdash;always
friend; Edgar going to
America to lecture, and make the fortune
that&mdash;he said&mdash;would make all things possible.
He had said that on the last evening, when
a lot of them&mdash;boys and girls, journalists,
musicians, art students&mdash;had gone to see him
off at Euston. He had said it at the instant
of farewell, and had looked a question. Had
she said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;&mdash;or only thought it? She
had often wondered that, even when her brain
was clear.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;she pushed away the next thought
with both hands, and drove herself back to
the day when the schoolboy next door whom
she had admired and hated, saved her pet
kitten from the butcher&rsquo;s dog&mdash;an heroic
episode with blood in it and tears. Edgar&rsquo;s
voice, the touch of his hand, the swing of
his waltz-step&mdash;the way his eyes smiled before
his mouth did. How bright his eyes were&mdash;and
his hands were very strong. He was
strong every way: he would fight for his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
life&mdash;even with the sea. Great, smooth, dark
waves seemed rushing upon her in the quiet
room; she could hear the sound of them
on the beach. Why had she come near
the sea? It was the same sea that&mdash;&mdash; She
pushed the waves away with both
hands. The church clock struck two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t go mad, you know,&rdquo; she
told herself very gently and reasonably,
&ldquo;because of the boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her hands had got clenched somehow, her
whole body was rigid. She relaxed the tense
muscles deliberately, made up the fire, swept
up the hearth.</p>

<p>The new flame her touch inspired flickered
a red reflection on the face of the cabinet&mdash;the
cabinet with the secret drawer that had
&ldquo;inspired Edgar with mysterious tales.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jane went to it, and patted it, and stroked
it, and coaxed it to tell her its secret. But
it would not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it would only inspire <i>me</i>,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if
I could only get an idea for the story, I
could do it now&mdash;this minute. Lots of people
work best at night. My brain&rsquo;s really quite
clear again now, or else I shouldn&rsquo;t be able
to remember all these silly little things. No,
no,&rdquo; she cried to a memory of a young man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
kissing a glove, a little creeping memory
that came to sting. She trampled on it.</p>

<p>Next day Jane walked four miles to see a
doctor and get a sleeping draught.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she explained very earnestly,
&ldquo;I have some work to finish, and if I don&rsquo;t
sleep I can&rsquo;t. And I must do it. I can&rsquo;t
tell you how important it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor gave her something in a bottle
when he had asked a few questions, and she
went back to the cottage to go on bearing what
was left of the interminable, intolerable day.</p>

<p>That was the day when she set out the
fair white writing paper, and the rosy blotting-paper,
and the black ink and the black fountain
pen, and sat and looked at them for hours and
hours. She prayed for help&mdash;but no help
came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m probably praying to the wrong people,&rdquo;
she said, when through the dusk the square
of paper showed vague as a tombstone in
twilit grass&mdash;&ldquo;the wrong people&mdash;No, there
are no tombstones in the sea&mdash;the wrong
people. If St Anthony helps you to find
things, and the other saints help you to be
good, perhaps the dead people who used to
write themselves are the ones to help one
to write!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
Jane is ashamed to be quite sure that she
remembers praying to Dante and Shakespeare,
and at last to Christina Rossetti,
because she was a woman and loved her
brothers.</p>

<p>But no help came. The old woman fussed
in and out with wood for the fire&mdash;candles&mdash;food.
Very kindly, it appears, but Jane
wished she wouldn&rsquo;t. Jane thinks she must
have eaten some of the food, or the old
woman would not have left her as she
did.</p>

<p>Jane took the draught, and went to bed.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>When Mrs Beale came into the sitting-room
next morning, a neat pile of manuscript
lay on the table, and when she took a cup
of tea to Jane&rsquo;s bedside, Jane was sleeping
so placidly that the old woman had not the
heart to disturb her, and set the tea down
on a chair by the pillow to turn white and
cold.</p>

<p>When Jane came into the sitting-room,
she stood long looking at the manuscript.
At last she picked it up, and, still standing,
read it through. When she had finished,
she stood a long time with it in her hand.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
At last she shrugged her shoulders and sat
down. She wrote to Milly.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Here is the story. I don&rsquo;t know how
I&rsquo;ve done it, but here it is. Do read it&mdash;because
I really am a little mad, and if it&rsquo;s
any good, send it in at once to the <i>Monthly
Multitude</i>. I slept all last night. I shall soon
be well now. Everything is so delightful, and
the air is splendid. A thousand thanks for
sending me here. I am enjoying the rest
and change immensely.&mdash;Your grateful</p>

<p class="sig">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Jane</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>She read it through. Her smile at the
last phrase was not pretty to see.</p>

<p>When the long envelope was posted, Jane
went down to the quiet shore and gazed
out over the sunlit sands to the opal line
of the far receding tide.</p>

<p>The story was written. There was an
end to the conflict of agonies, so now the
fiercer agony had the field to itself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I shall learn to bear it
presently,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;I wish I had
not forgotten how to cry. I am sure I
ought to cry. But the story is done, anyway.
I daresay I shall remember how to
cry before the next story has to be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were two more nights and one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
whole day. The nights had islands of sleep
in them&mdash;hot, misty islands in a river of slow,
crawling, sluggish hours. The day was
light and breezy and sunny, with a blue sky
cloud-flecked. The day was worse than the
nights, because in the day she remembered
all the time who she was, and where.</p>

<p>It was on the last day of the week. She
was sitting rigid in the little porch, her eyes
tracing again and again with conscious
intentness the twisted pattern of the budding
honeysuckle stalks. A rattle of wheels
suddenly checked came to her, and she
untwisted her stiff fingers and went down
the path to meet Milly&mdash;a pale Milly, with
red spots in her cheeks and fierce, frowning
brows&mdash;a Milly who drew back from the
offered kiss and spoke in tones that neither
had heard before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come inside. I want to speak to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The new disaster thus plainly heralded
moved Jane not at all. There was no room
in her soul for any more pain. In the little
dining-room, conscientiously &ldquo;quaint&rdquo; with
its spotted crockery dogs and corner cupboard
shining with willow pattern tea-cups, Milly
shut the door and turned on her friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I came down to see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
you, because there are some things I couldn&rsquo;t
write&mdash;even to you. You can go back to
the station in the cab, I&rsquo;ve told the man to
wait. And I hope I shall never see your
face again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Jane asked the
question mechanically, and not at all because
she did not know the answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know what I mean,&rdquo; the other
answered, still with white fury. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
found you out. You thought you were
safe, and Edgar was dead, and no one
would know. But as it happens <i>I</i> knew;
and so shall everybody else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jane moistened dry lips, and said: &ldquo;Knew
what?&rdquo; and held on by the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d told <i>me</i> about
it, did you?&rdquo; Milly flashed&mdash;&ldquo;but he did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you must tell <i>me</i> what you
mean,&rdquo; Jane said, and shifted her hold from
table to armchair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly.&rdquo; Milly tossed her head,
and Jane&rsquo;s fingers tightened on the chair-back.
&ldquo;Yes, I don&rsquo;t wonder you look ill&mdash;I
suppose you were sorry when you&rsquo;d done
it. But it&rsquo;s no use being sorry; you should
have thought of all that before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; said Jane, low.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you fast enough. You shall
see I do know. Well, then, that story you
sent me&mdash;you just copied it from a story
of Edgar&rsquo;s that was in the old cabinet.
He wrote it when he was here; and he said
it wasn&rsquo;t good, and I said it was, and then
he said he&rsquo;d leave it in the secret drawer,
and see how it looked when he came back.
And you found it. And you thought you
were very clever, I daresay, and that Edgar
was dead, and no one would know. But
I knew, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jane interrupted, &ldquo;you said that
before. So you think I found Edgar&rsquo;s
manuscript? If I did it I must have done
it in my sleep. I used to walk in my
sleep when I was a child. You believe me,
Milly, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Milly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll say nothing more,&rdquo; said Jane
with bitter dignity. &ldquo;I will go at once, and
I will try to forgive your cruelty. <i>I</i> would
never have doubted <i>your</i> word&mdash;never. I am
very ill&mdash;look at me. I had a sleeping
draught, and I suppose it upset me: such
things have happened. You&rsquo;ve known me
eight or nine years: have you ever known
me do a dishonourable thing, or tell a lie?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
The dishonour is in yourself, to believe such
things of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jane had drawn herself up, and stood, tall
and haggard, her dark eyes glowing in their
deep sockets. The other woman was daunted.
She hesitated, stammered half a word, and
was silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; said Jane; &ldquo;and I hope to
God no one will ever be such a brute to
you as you have been to me.&rdquo; She turned,
but before she reached the door Milly had
caught her by the arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I <i>do</i> believe
you, I do! You poor darling! You must
have done it in your sleep. Oh, forgive me,
Jane dear. I&rsquo;ll never tell a soul, and
Edgar&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Jane, turning mournful eyes
on her, &ldquo;Edgar would have believed in me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And at that Milly understood&mdash;in part,
at least&mdash;and held out her arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you poor dear! and I never even
guessed! Oh, forgive me!&rdquo; and she cried over
Jane and kissed her many times. &ldquo;Oh, my
dear!&rdquo; she said, as Jane yielded herself to
the arms and her face to the kisses, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got something to tell you. You must be
brave.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
&ldquo;No&mdash;no more,&rdquo; Jane said shrilly; &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t bear any more. I don&rsquo;t want to know
how it happened, or anything. He&rsquo;s dead&mdash;that&rsquo;s
enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Milly clung sobbing to her,
sobbing with sympathy and agitation.</p>

<p>Jane pushed her back, held her at arm&rsquo;s
length and looked at her with eyes that were
still dry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good little thing, after all,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;now I&rsquo;ll tell you. You were
quite right. It was a lie&mdash;but half of it
was true&mdash;the half I told you&mdash;but I wanted
you to believe the other half too. I did
walk in my sleep, and I must have opened
that cabinet and taken Edgar&rsquo;s story out,
because I found myself standing there with
it in my hands. And he was dead, and&mdash;&mdash; Oh,
Milly. I knew he was dead, of course,
and yet he was there&mdash;I give you my word
he was there, and I heard him say &lsquo;Take it,
take it, take it!&rsquo; quite plainly, like I&rsquo;m
speaking to you now. And I took it; and
I copied it out&mdash;it took me nearly all night&mdash;and
then I sent it to you. And I&rsquo;d never
have told you the truth as long as you didn&rsquo;t
believe me&mdash;never&mdash;never. But now you do
believe me I won&rsquo;t lie to you. There! Let
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
me go. I think I was mad then, and I know
I am now. Tell every one. I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Milly threw her arms round her again.
The love interest had overpowered the moral
sense. What did the silly story, or the theft,
or the lie matter&mdash;what were they, compared
with the love-secret she had surprised?</p>

<p>&ldquo;My darling Jane,&rdquo; she said, holding her
friend closely and still weeping lavishly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
worry about the story: I quite understand.
Let&rsquo;s forget it. You&rsquo;ve got quite enough
trouble to bear without that. But there&rsquo;s
one thing, it&rsquo;s just as well I found out before
the story was published. Because Edgar
isn&rsquo;t dead. His ship has been towed in:
he&rsquo;s at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jane laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, dear,&rdquo; said Milly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help
you to bear it. Only&mdash;oh dear, how awful
it is for you!&mdash;he&rsquo;s going to be married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jane laughed again; and then she thinks
the great, green waves really did rise up all
round the quaint dining-room&mdash;rise mountains
high, and, falling, cover her.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Jane was ill so long that Milly had to tell
Edgar about the story after all, and they sent
it in, and it was published in Jane&rsquo;s name.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
So the little brothers were all right. And he
wrote the next story for her too, and they
corrected the proofs together.</p>

<p>Jane has always thought it a pity that
Milly had not troubled to ask the name of
the girl whom Edgar intended to marry,
because the name proved, on enquiry, to be
Jane.</p>

<br />
THE MILLIONAIRESS</h2>

<p class="center lrgfont smlpadb">I</p>

<p>It is a dismal thing to be in London in
August. The streets are up for one thing,
and your cab can never steer a straight course
for the place you want to go to. And the
trees are brown in the parks, and every one
you know is away, so that there would be
nowhere to go in your cab, even if you had
the money to pay for it, and you could go
there without extravagance.</p>

<p>Stephen Guillemot sat over his uncomfortable
breakfast-table in the rooms he shared
with his friend, and cursed his luck. His
friend was away by the sea, and he was
here in the dirty and sordid blackness of
his Temple chambers. But he had no money
for a holiday; and when Dornington had
begged him to accept a loan, he had sworn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
at Dornington, and Dornington had gone off
not at all pleased. And now Dornington
was by the sea, and he was here. The flies
buzzed in the panes and round the sticky
marmalade jar; the sun poured in at the
open window. There was no work to do.
Stephen was a solicitor by trade; but, in
fact and perforce, an idler. No business came
to him. All day long the steps of clients
sounded on the dirty, old wooden staircase&mdash;clients
for Robinson on the second, for Jones
on the fourth, but none for Guillemot on the
third. Even now steps were coming, though
it was only ten o&rsquo;clock. The young man
glanced at the marmalade jar, at the crooked
cloth stained with tea, which his laundress
had spread for his breakfast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose it is a client&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off
with a laugh. He had never been able to
cure himself of that old hope that some day
the feet of a client&mdash;a wealthy client&mdash;would
pause at his door, but the feet had always
gone by&mdash;as these would do. The steps did
indeed pass his door, paused, came back, and&mdash;oh
wonder! it was <i>his</i> knocker that awoke
the Temple echoes.</p>

<p>He glanced at the table. It was hopeless.
He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
&ldquo;I daresay it&rsquo;s only a bill,&rdquo; he said, and
went to see.</p>

<p>The newcomer was impatient, for even as
Guillemot opened the door, the knocker was
in act to fall again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Mr Guillemot&mdash;&mdash; Oh, Stephen, I
should have known you anywhere!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A radiant vision in a white linen gown&mdash;a
very smart tailor-made-looking linen gown&mdash;and
a big white hat was standing in his doorway,
shaking him warmly by the hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you ask me in?&rdquo; asked the vision,
smiling in his bewildered face.</p>

<p>He drew back mechanically, and closed the
door after him as she went in. Then he
followed her into the room that served him
for office and living-room, and stood looking
at her helplessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know me a bit,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s a shame to tease you. I&rsquo;ll take off my
hat and veil; you will know me then. It&rsquo;s
these fine feathers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And take them off she did&mdash;in front of the
fly-spotted glass on the mantel-piece; then
she turned a bright face on him, a pretty
mobile face, crowned with bright brown hair.
And still he stood abashed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never thought you would have forgotten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
the friend of childhood&rsquo;s hour,&rdquo; she began
again. &ldquo;I see I must tell you in cold blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Rosamund!&rdquo; he cried suddenly.
&ldquo;Do forgive me! I never, never dreamed&mdash;&mdash; My
dear Rosamund, you aren&rsquo;t really changed
a bit it&rsquo;s only&mdash;your hair being done up
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the fine feathers,&rdquo; said she, holding
out a fold of her dress. &ldquo;They are very
pretty feathers, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; said he. And then suddenly a
silence of embarrassment fell between them.</p>

<p>The girl broke it with a laugh that was
not quite spontaneous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How funny it all is!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
went to New York with my uncle when
dear papa died&mdash;and then I went to Girton,
and now poor uncle&rsquo;s dead, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Her
eye fell on the tablecloth. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to clear
away this horrid breakfast of yours,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, please!&rdquo; he pleaded, taking the
marmalade jar up in his helpless hands.
She took the jar from him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; she said firmly; &ldquo;and you can
just sit down and try to remember who I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He obediently withdrew to the window-seat
and watched her as she took away the ugly
crockery and the uglier food to hide them in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
his little kitchen; and as he watched her he
remembered many things. The lonely childhood
in a country rectory&mdash;the long, dull days
with no playfellows; then the arrival of the
new doctor and his little daughter Rosamund
Rainham&mdash;and almost at the same time, it
seemed, the invalid lady with the little boy
who lodged at the Post Office. Then there
were playfellows, dear playfellows, to cheer
and teach him&mdash;poor Stephen, he hardly
knew what play or laughter meant. Then
the invalid lady died, and Stephen&rsquo;s father
awoke from his dreams amid his old books,
as he had a way of doing now and then,
enquired into the circumstances of the boy,
Andrew Dornington, and, finding him friendless
and homeless, took him into his home
to be Stephen&rsquo;s little brother and friend.
Then the long happy time when the three
children were always together: walking, boating,
birdsnesting, reading, playing and quarrelling;
the storm of tears from Rosamund when
the boys went to College; the shock of surprise
and the fleeting sadness with which Stephen
heard that the doctor was dead and that Rosamund
had gone to America to her mother&rsquo;s
brother. Then the fulness of living, the old
days almost forgotten, or only remembered as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
a pleasant dream. Stephen had never thought
to see Rosamund again&mdash;had certainly never
longed very ardently to see her; at any rate,
since the year of her going. And now&mdash;here
she was, grown to womanhood and charm,
clearing away his breakfast things! He could
hear the tap running, and knew that she must
be washing her hands at the sink, using the
horrid bit of yellow soap with tea-leaves
embedded in it. Now she was drying her
hands on the dingy towel behind the kitchen
door. No; she came in drying her pink
fingers on her handkerchief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a horrid old charwoman you must
have!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;everything is six inches
deep in dust&mdash;and all your crockery is
smeary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry it&rsquo;s not nicer,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Oh,
but it&rsquo;s good to see you again! What times
we used to have! Do you remember when
we burned your dolls on the 5th of
November?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think I did. And do you
remember when I painted your new tool-chest
and the handles of your saws and
gimlets and things with pale green enamel?
I thought you would be so pleased.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had taken her place, as she spoke, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
the depths of the one comfortable chair, and
he answered from his window-seat; and in
a moment the two were launched on a flood
of reminiscences, and the flight of time was
not one of the things they remembered. The
hour and the quarters sounded, and they
talked on. But the insistence of noon,
boomed by the Law Courts&rsquo; clock, brought
Miss Rainham to her feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twelve!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;How time goes!
And I&rsquo;ve never told you what I came for.
Look here. I&rsquo;m frightfully rich; I only
heard it last week. My uncle never seemed
very well off. We lived very simply, and
I used to do the washing-up and the dusting
and things; and now he&rsquo;s died and left me
all his money. I don&rsquo;t know where he kept
it all. The people on the floor above here
wrote me about it. I was going to see them,
and I saw your name; and I simply couldn&rsquo;t
pass it. Look here, Stephen&mdash;are you very
busy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not too busy to do anything you want.
I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve had luck. What can I do
for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you really do anything I want?
Promise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I promise.&rdquo; He looked at her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
and wondered if she knew how hard it would
be to him to refuse her anything: for Mr
Guillemot had been fancy free, and this
gracious vision, re-risen from old times, had
turned his head a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! You must be my solicitor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t. Jones&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bother Jones!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t go
near him. I won&rsquo;t be worried by Jones.
What is the use of having a fortune&mdash;and it&rsquo;s
a big fortune, I can tell you&mdash;if I mayn&rsquo;t
even choose my own solicitor? Look here,
Stephen&mdash;really&mdash;I have no relations and no
friends in England&mdash;no man friends, I mean&mdash;and
you won&rsquo;t charge me more than you
ought, but you will charge me enough. Oh,
I feel like Mr Boffin&mdash;and you are Mortimer
Lightwood, and Andrew is Eugene. Do you
call him Dora still?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the first question she had asked
about the boy who had shared all their
youth with them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dornington is all right. He&rsquo;d be
awfully sick if you called him Dora nowadays.
He&rsquo;s got on a little&mdash;not much. He goes
in for journalism. He&rsquo;s at Lymchurch just
now; he lives here with me generally.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I know; I saw his name on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
door.&rdquo; And Stephen did not wonder till
later why she had not mentioned that name
earlier in the interview.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, give me paper and pens, the best
there is time to procure. Now tell me what
to say to Jones. I want to tell him that I
loathe his very name; that I know I could
never bear the sight of him; and that you
are going to look after everything for
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He resisted&mdash;she pleaded; and at last the
letter was written, not quite in those terms,
and Stephen at her request reluctantly instructed
her as to the method of giving a
Power of Attorney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must arrange everything,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be bothered. Now I must go. Jones
is human, after all. He knew I should want
money, and he sent me quite a lot. And I
am going away for a holiday&mdash;just to see what
it feels like to be rich.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going about alone, I hope,&rdquo;
said Stephen. And then, for the first time,
he remembered that beautiful young ladies
are not allowed to clear away tea-things in
the Temple, without a chaperon&mdash;even for
their solicitors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; Constance Grant is with me. You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
don&rsquo;t know her. I got to know her at Girton.
She&rsquo;s a dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, awkwardly standing
behind her as she pinned her hat and veil in
front of his glass, &ldquo;when you come back I&rsquo;ll
come to see you. But you mustn&rsquo;t come here
again; it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s not customary.&rdquo; She smiled
at his reflection in the glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I forgot your stiff English notions!
So absurd! Not going to see one&rsquo;s old friend
<i>and</i> one&rsquo;s <i>solicitor</i>! However, I won&rsquo;t come
where I&rsquo;m not wanted&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began reproachfully;
but she interrupted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, it&rsquo;s all right. Now remember
that all my affairs are in your hands, and
when I come back you will have to tell me
exactly what I am worth&mdash;between eight and
fourteen hundred thousand pounds, they say;
but <i>that&rsquo;s</i> nonsense, isn&rsquo;t it? Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with a last switch of white skirts
against the dirty wainscot, and a last wave
of a white-gloved hand, she disappeared down
the staircase.</p>

<p>Stephen drew a long breath. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be
fourteen hundred thousand,&rdquo; he said slowly;
&ldquo;but I wish to goodness it wasn&rsquo;t four-pence.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p class="center lrgfont smlpadt smlpadb">II</p>

<p>The tide was low, the long lines of the sandbanks
shone yellow in the sun&mdash;yellower for
the pools of blue water left between them.
Far off, where the low white streak marked
the edge of the still retreating sea, little
figures moved slowly along, pushing the
shrimping-nets through the shallow water.</p>

<p>On one of the smooth wave-worn groins a
girl sat sketching the village; her pink gown
and red Japanese umbrella made a bright spot
on the gold of the sand.</p>

<p>Further along the beach, under the end of
the grass-grown sea-wall, a young man and
woman basked in the August sun. Her
sunshade was white, and so were her gown
and the hat that lay beside her. Since her
accession to fortune Rosamund Rainham had
worn nothing but white.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the prettiest wear in the world,&rdquo; she
had told Constance Grant; &ldquo;and when you&rsquo;re
poor, it&rsquo;s the most impossible. But now I
can have a clean gown every day, and a clean
conscience as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure about the conscience,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
Constance had answered with her demure
smile. &ldquo;Think of the millions of poor
people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, bother!&rdquo; Miss Rainham had laughed,
not heartlessly, but happily. &ldquo;Thank Heaven,
I&rsquo;ve enough to be happy myself and make
heaps of other people happy too. And the
first step is that no one&rsquo;s to know I&rsquo;m rich,
so remember that we are two high-school
teachers on a holiday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I loathe play-acting,&rdquo; Constance had said,
but she had submitted, and now she sat
sketching, and Rosamund in her white gown
watched the seagulls and shrimpers from
under the sea-wall of Lymchurch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so your holiday&rsquo;s over in three days,&rdquo;
she was saying to the young man beside her;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s been a good time, hasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not answer; he was piling up the
pebbles in a heap, and always at a certain
point the heap collapsed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you thinking of? Poems
again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had a verse running in my head,&rdquo; he
said apologetically; &ldquo;it has nothing to do with
anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Write it down at once,&rdquo; she said imperiously,
and he obediently scribbled in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
notebook, while she took up the work of
building the stone heap&mdash;it grew higher under
her light fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Read it!&rdquo; she said, when the scribbling
of the pencil stopped, and he read:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Now the vexed clouds, wind-driven, spread wings of white,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Long leaning wings across the sea and land;</span><br />

<span class="i2">The treasure-house of their deserted sand;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And where the nearer waves curl white and low,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Knee-deep in swirling brine the slow-foot shrimpers go.</span><br />
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Pale breadth of sand where clamorous gulls confer</span><br />
<span class="i2">Marked with broad arrows by their planted feet,</span><br />
<span class="i0">White rippled pools where late deep waters were,</span><br />
<span class="i2">And ever the white waves marshalled in retreat,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the grey wind in sole supremacy</span><br />
<span class="i0">O&rsquo;er opal and amber cold of darkening sky and sea.&rdquo;</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Opal and amber cold,&rdquo; she repeated; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
not like that now. It&rsquo;s sapphire and gold
and diamonds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but that was how it
was last week&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before I came&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, before you came;&rdquo; his tone put a
new meaning into her words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I brought good weather,&rdquo; she
said cheerfully, and the little stone heap
rattled itself down under her hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
&ldquo;You brought the light of the world,&rdquo;
he said, and caught her hand and held it.
There was a silence. A fisherman passing
along the sea-wall gave them good-day.
&ldquo;What made you come to Lymchurch?&rdquo; he
said presently, and his hand lay lightly on
hers. She hesitated, and looked down at her
hand and his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew you were here,&rdquo; she said. His
eyes met hers. &ldquo;I always meant to see you
again some day. And you knew me at once.
That was so nice of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not changed,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;your
face has not changed, only you are older,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m twenty-two; you needn&rsquo;t reproach
me with it. Yours is the same to a month.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He moved on his elbow a little nearer to
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has it ever occurred to you,&rdquo; he asked,
looking out to sea, &ldquo;that you and I were
made for each other?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; never.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked out to sea still, and his face
clouded heavily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;no&mdash;don&rsquo;t look like that, dear; it
never occurred to me&mdash;I think I must have
always known it somehow, only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
&ldquo;Only what?&mdash;do you really?&mdash;only what?&rdquo;
A silence. Then, &ldquo;Only what?&rdquo; he asked
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only I was so afraid it would never occur
to <i>you</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no one on the wide, bare sands
save the discreet artist&mdash;their faces were
very near.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall be very, very poor, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo;
he said presently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can go on teaching.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&rdquo;&mdash;his voice was decided&mdash;&ldquo;my wife
shan&rsquo;t work&mdash;at least not anywhere but in
our home. You won&rsquo;t mind playing at love
in a cottage for a bit, will you? I shall get
on now I&rsquo;ve something to work for. Oh,
my dear, thank God I&rsquo;ve enough for the
cottage! When will you marry me? We&rsquo;ve
nothing to wait for, no relations to consult,
no settlements to draw up. All that&rsquo;s mine
is thine, lassie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And all that&rsquo;s mine&mdash;Oh! Stephen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For, with a scattering of shingle, a man
dropped from the sea-wall two yards from
them.</p>

<p>The situation admitted of no disguise,
for Miss Rainham&rsquo;s head was on Mr
Dornington&rsquo;s shoulder. They sprang up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
&ldquo;Why, Stephen!&rdquo; echoed Andrew, &ldquo;this&mdash;this
is good of you! You remember
Rosamund? We have just found out that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
But Rosamund had turned, and was
walking quickly away over the sand.</p>

<p>Stephen filled a pipe and lighted it
before he said: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made good use of
your time, old man. I congratulate you.&rdquo;
His tone was cold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no reason why I should not
make good use of my time,&rdquo; Dornington
answered, and his tone had caught the chill
of the other&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None whatever. You have secured the
prize, and I congratulate you. Whether
it&rsquo;s fair to the girl is another question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In moments of agitation a man instinctively
feels for his pipe. It was now Dornington&rsquo;s
turn to fill and light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s your own affair,&rdquo; said
Guillemot, chafing at the silence, &ldquo;but I
think you might have given the heiress a
chance. However, it&rsquo;s each for himself, I
suppose, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heiress?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the heiress&mdash;the Millionairess, if you
prefer it. I&rsquo;ve been looking into her affairs:
it <i>is</i> just about a million.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
&ldquo;Rather cheap chaff, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very lucky thing for you,&rdquo; said
Stephen savagely. &ldquo;Perhaps I ought not
to grudge it to you. But I must say,
Dornington&mdash;I see we look at the thing
differently&mdash;but I must say, I shouldn&rsquo;t
have cared to grab at such luck myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dornington had thrust his hands into
his pockets, and stood looking at his
friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;And her fortune
is really so much? I didn&rsquo;t think it had been
so much as that. Yes. Well, Guillemot, it&rsquo;s
no good making a row about it; I don&rsquo;t
want to quarrel with my best friend. Go
along to my place, will you? Or stay: come
and let me introduce you to Miss Grant,
and you can walk up with her; she&rsquo;ll show
you where I live. I&rsquo;m going for a bit of a
walk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Five minutes later Stephen, in response
to Rosamund&rsquo;s beckoning hand at the
window, was following Miss Grant up the
narrow flagged path leading to the cottage
which Rosamund had taken. And ten
minutes later Andrew Dornington was
striding along the road to the station with
a Gladstone bag in his hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
Stephen lunched at the cottage. The
girls served the lunch themselves; they had
no hired service in the little cottage.
Rosamund exerted herself to talk gaily.</p>

<p>As the meal ended, a fair-haired child
stood in the door that opened straight from
the street into the sitting-room, after the
primitive fashion of Lymchurch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E gave me a letter for you,&rdquo; said the
child, and Rosamund took it, giving in
exchange some fruit from the pretty
disordered table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; she said, with the rose in
her cheeks because she saw the hand-writing
was the hand-writing she had seen in many
pencilled verses. She read the letter,
frowned, read it again. &ldquo;Constance, you
might get the coffee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Constance went out. Then the girl turned
on her guest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is <i>your</i> doing,&rdquo; she said with a
concentrated fury that brought him to his
feet facing her. &ldquo;Why did you come and
meddle! You&rsquo;ve told him I was rich&mdash;the
very thing I didn&rsquo;t mean him to know till&mdash;till
he couldn&rsquo;t help himself. You&rsquo;ve spoilt everything!
And now he&rsquo;s gone&mdash;and he&rsquo;ll never
come back. Oh, I hope you will suffer for this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
some day. You will, if there&rsquo;s any justice in
the world!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked as though he suffered for it
even now, but when he spoke his voice was
equable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am extremely sorry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but after
all, there&rsquo;s very little harm done. You should
have warned me that you meant to play a
comedy, and I would have taken any part
you assigned me. However, you&rsquo;ve succeeded.
He evidently &lsquo;loves you for yourself alone.&rsquo;
Write and tell him to come back: he&rsquo;ll
come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How little you know him,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;after all these years! Even I know him
better than that. That was why I pretended
not to be rich. Directly I knew about the
money I made up my mind to find him and
try if I could make him care. I know
it sounds horrid; I don&rsquo;t mind, it&rsquo;s true.
And I had done it; and then you came.
Oh, I hope I shall never see you again!
I will never speak to you again! No, I don&rsquo;t
mean that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She hid her face in her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rosamund, try to forgive me. I didn&rsquo;t
know, I couldn&rsquo;t know. I will bring him
back to you&mdash;I swear it! Only trust me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all over.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
&ldquo;Let me tell you something. If you hadn&rsquo;t
had this money&mdash;but if you hadn&rsquo;t had this
money I should never have seen you. But
I have thought of nothing but you ever since
that day you came to the Temple. I don&rsquo;t
tell you this to annoy you, only to show
you that I would do anything in the world
to prevent you from being unhappy. Forgive
me, dear! Oh, forgive me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good,&rdquo; she said; but she gave
him her hand. When Constance Grant came
back with the coffee, she found Mr Guillemot
alone looking out of the window at the sunflowers
and the hollyhocks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made a fool of myself,&rdquo; he said,
forgetting, as he looked at her kind eyes,
that three hours ago she was only a name
to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could I do anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re her friend,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Miss Grant,
I&rsquo;m going down to the sea, if you could
come down with me and let me talk&mdash;but
I&rsquo;ve no right to bother you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; said Constance. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come
by-and-by when I&rsquo;ve cleared lunch away.
It&rsquo;s no bother. As you say, I&rsquo;m her friend.&rdquo;</p>


<hr style="width: 45%;" />


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p class="center lrgfont smlpadt smlpadb">III</p>

<p>Rosamund stayed on at the little house
behind the sea-wall, and she wrote letters,
long and many, which accumulated on the
mantel-piece of the rooms in the Temple.
Andrew found them there when he returned
to town in the middle of October. The
room was cheerless, tenantless, fireless. He
lit the gas and looked through his letters.
He did not dare to open those which came
from her. There were bills, invitation cards,
a returned manuscript or two, a cheque for
a magazine article, and a letter in Stephen&rsquo;s
hand-writing. It was dated a fortnight
earlier.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear old Chap</span>,&rdquo; it ran, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off to my
father&rsquo;s. I can&rsquo;t bear it. I can&rsquo;t face you
or any one. I wish to God I&rsquo;d never told
you anything about Rosamund Rainham&rsquo;s
money. There isn&rsquo;t any money: it was
all in the Crystal Oil Co. No one had the
least idea that it wasn&rsquo;t good, but I feel as if
I ought to have known. There&rsquo;s a beggarly
hundred or so in consols: that&rsquo;s the end of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
her million. It wasn&rsquo;t really my fault, of
course. She doesn&rsquo;t blame me.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<p class="sig">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Stephen Guillemot</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Then he opened her letters&mdash;read them all&mdash;in
the order of the dates on the postmarks,
for even in love Andrew was an orderly man&mdash;read
them with eyes that pricked and
smarted. There were four or five of them.
First, the frank pleading of affection, then
the coldness of hurt pride and love; then,
doubts, wonderings. Was he ill? Was he
away? Would he not at least answer?
Passionate longing, tender anxiety breathed
in every word. Then came the last letter
of all, written a fortnight ago:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Andrew</span>,&mdash;I want you to understand
that all is over between us. I know
you wished it, and now I see you are right.
I could never have been anything to you but
your loving friend,</p>

<p class="sig">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Rosamund</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>He read it through twice; it was a greater
shock to him than Stephen&rsquo;s letter had been.
Then he understood. The Millionairess
might stoop to woo a poor lover whose pride
had fought with and conquered his love: the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
girl with only a &ldquo;beggarly hundred in consols&rdquo;
had her pride too.</p>

<p>The early October dusk filled the room.
Andrew caught up the bag he had brought
with him, slammed the door, and blundered
down the stairs. He caught a passing hansom
in Fleet Street and the last train to
Lymchurch.</p>

<p>A furious south-wester was waiting for him
there. He could hardly stand against it&mdash;it
blew and tore and buffeted him, almost prevailing
against him as he staggered down the
road from the station. The night was inky
black, but he knew his Lymchurch every inch,
and he fought it manfully, though every now
and then he was fain to cling to a gateway
or a post, and hold on till the gust had passed.
Thus, breathless and dishevelled, his tie under
his left ear, his hat battered in, his hair in
crisp disorder, he reached at last the haven of
the little porch of the house under the sea-wall.</p>

<p>Rosamund herself opened the door; her
eyes showed him two things&mdash;her love and
her pride. Which would be the stronger?
He remembered how the question had been
answered in his own case, and he shivered
as she took his hand and led him into the
warm, lamp-lighted room. The curtains were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
drawn; the hearth swept; a tabby cat purred
on the rug; a book lay open on the table:
all breathed of the sober comfort of home.
She sat down on the other side of the hearth
and looked at him. Neither spoke. It was
an awkward moment.</p>

<p>Rosamund broke the silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very friendly of you to come and see
me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is very lonely for me now.
Constance has gone back to London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has gone back to her teaching?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I wanted her to stay, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard from Stephen. He is very
wretched; he seems to think it is his fault.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor, dear boy!&rdquo; She spoke musingly.
&ldquo;Of course it wasn&rsquo;t his fault. It all seems
like a dream, to have been so rich for a little
while, and to have done nothing with it
except,&rdquo; she added with a laugh and a
glance at her fur-trimmed dress, &ldquo;to buy a
most extravagant number of white dresses.
How awfully tired you look, Andrew! Go
and have a wash&mdash;the spare room&rsquo;s the first
door at the top of the stairs&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll get
you some supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he came down again, she had laid
a cloth on the table and was setting out
silver and glass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
&ldquo;Another relic of my brief prosperity,&rdquo; she
said, touching the forks and spoons. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
glad I don&rsquo;t have to eat with nickel-plated
things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She talked gaily as they ate. The home
atmosphere of the room touched Dornington.
Rosamund herself, in her white gown,
had never appeared so fair and desirable.
And but for his own mad pride he might
have been here now, sharing her pretty little
home life with her&mdash;not as her guest, but as
her husband. He flushed crimson. Blushing
was an old trick of his&mdash;one of those that
had earned him his feminine nickname of
Dora, and in the confusion his blushing
brought him, he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rosamund, can you ever forgive me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I forgive you from my heart,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;if I have anything to forgive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But in her tone was the resentment of
a woman who does not forgive. Yet he had
been right. He had sacrificed himself; and
if he had chosen to suffer? But what about
the blue lines under her dear eyes, the
hollows in her dear face?</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been unhappy,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t exactly
pleased to lose my fortune.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
&ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; he said desperately, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t you
try to forgive me? It seemed right. How
could I sacrifice you to a penniless&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d enough for both&mdash;or thought I had,&rdquo;
she said obstinately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but don&rsquo;t you see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see that you cared more for not being
thought mercenary by Stephen than&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me!&rdquo; he pleaded; &ldquo;take me back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no&rdquo;&mdash;she tossed her bright head&mdash;&ldquo;Stephen
might think me mercenary; I
couldn&rsquo;t bear <i>that</i>. You see you are richer
than I am now. How much did you tell
me you made a year by your writing? How
can I sacrifice you to a penniless&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rosamund, do you mean it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do mean it. And, besides&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t love you any more.&rdquo; The bright
head drooped and turned away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have killed your love. I don&rsquo;t wonder.
Forgive me for bothering you. Good-bye!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; she asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be afraid, nothing desperate.
Only work hard and try to forgive you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive <i>me</i>? You have nothing to
forgive.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
&ldquo;No, nothing&mdash;if you had left off loving
me? Have you? Is it true?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are staying
at the &lsquo;Ship&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s part in anger. I shall be on
the sea-wall in the morning. Let&rsquo;s part
friends, then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the morning Andrew went into the fresh
air. The trees, still gold in calmer homes,
stood almost leafless in wild, windy Lymchurch.
He stood in the sunlight, and in
spite of himself some sort of gladness came
to him through the crisp October air. Then
the <i>ping</i> of a bicycle bell sounded close
behind him, and there was Stephen.</p>

<p>They shook hands, and Stephen&rsquo;s eyebrows
went up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it all right?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I knew
you&rsquo;d come here when I came home last
night and found you&rsquo;d had my letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; it&rsquo;s not all right. She won&rsquo;t have me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pride or revenge, or something. Don&rsquo;t
let&rsquo;s talk about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. I want some breakfast; we
left town by the 7.20. I&rsquo;m starving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are &lsquo;we&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
&ldquo;Miss Grant and I. I thought Rosamund
would be wanting a <i>chaperon</i> or a bridesmaid,
or something, so I brought her and her
bicycle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Always thoughtful,&rdquo; said Andrew, with
something like a laugh.</p>

<p>Presently, strolling along the sea-wall they
met the two girls. Rosamund looked radiant.
Where was the pale, hollow-eyed darling of
last night? The wind that ruffled her brown
hair had blown roses into her cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you forgive me?&rdquo; whispered Stephen
when they met.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

<p>They all walked on together, and presently
Stephen and Constance fell behind.</p>

<p>Then Rosamund spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You really think I ought to crush my
pride, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hope laughed in Andrew&rsquo;s face&mdash;laughed
and fled&mdash;for he looked in the face of Miss
Rainham, and there was no sign of yielding
in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said almost sullenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is as much as to say that you were
wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;perhaps I was wrong. What does it
matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
&ldquo;It matters greatly. Suppose I had my
money now would you run away from me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I suppose I should act as I did before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t care for me any more than
you did?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love you a thousand times more,&rdquo; he
cried, turning angry, haggard eyes to her.
&ldquo;Yes, I believe I was wrong. Nothing would
send me from you now but yourself&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She clapped her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then stay,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for it&rsquo;s a farce, and
my money is as safe as houses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He scowled at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a trick? You&rsquo;ve played with me?
Good-bye, and God forgive you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned to go, but Constance, coming up
from behind them, caught his arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be such an idiot,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;<i>She</i>
had nothing to do with it. She thought her
money was gone. You don&rsquo;t suppose <i>she</i>
would have played such a trick even to win
<i>your</i> valuable affections. You don&rsquo;t deserve
your luck, Mr Dornington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rosamund was looking at him with wet
eyes, and her lips trembled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Constance only told me this morning,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;She and Stephen planned it, to
get you&mdash;to make me&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
&ldquo;And then she nearly spoilt it all by being
as silly as you were. Whatever does it matter
which of you has the money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Rosamund valiantly; &ldquo;I
see that plainly. Don&rsquo;t you, Andrew?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see nothing but you, Rosamund,&rdquo; he
said, and they turned and walked along the
sea-wall, hand in hand, like two children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Stephen; &ldquo;but, by
Jove, I&rsquo;ve had enough of playing Providence
and managing other people&rsquo;s affairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was very sweet about it,&rdquo; said Constance,
walking on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well she may be; she has her heart&rsquo;s
desire. But it was not easy. What a blessing
she is so unbusiness-like! I couldn&rsquo;t
have done it but for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very glad to have been of some
service,&rdquo; said Constance demurely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have got on without you. I
can&rsquo;t get on without you ever again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s nonsense,&rdquo; said Miss Grant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t make me, Constance? There&rsquo;s
no confounded money to come between <i>us</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He caught at the hand that swung by
her side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you said you loved <i>her</i>, and that
was why&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
&ldquo;Ah, but that was a thousand years ago.
And it was nonsense, even then, Constance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so two others went along the sea-wall
in the October sunshine, happily, like
children, hand in hand.</p>

THE HERMIT OF &ldquo;THE YEWS&rdquo;</h2>


<p>Maurice Brent knew a great deal about
the Greek anthology, and very little about
women. No one but himself had any idea
how much he knew of the one, and no
one had less idea than himself how little he
knew of the other. So that when, a stranger
and a pilgrim hopelessly astray amid a smart
house-party, he began to fall in love with
Camilla, it seemed to be no one&rsquo;s business
to tell him, what everybody else knew, that
Camilla had contracted the habit of becoming
engaged at least once a year. Of course
this always happened in the country, because
it was there that Camilla was most bored.
No other eligible young man happened
to be free at the moment: Camilla never
engaged herself to ineligibles. The habit
of years is not easily broken: Camilla
became engaged to Maurice, and, for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
six months of the engagement, he lived in
Paradise. A fool&rsquo;s Paradise, if you like,
but Paradise all the same.</p>

<p>About Easter time Camilla told him,
very nicely and kindly, that she had mistaken
her own heart&mdash;she hoped he would not let
it make him very unhappy. She would
always wish him the best of good fortune,
and doubtless he would find it in the affection
of some other girl much nicer and more
worthy of him than his sincere friend Camilla.
Camilla was right&mdash;no one could have been
less worthy of him than she: but after all it
was Camilla he thought that he loved, Camilla
he felt that he wanted, not any other girl
at all, no matter how nice or how worthy.</p>

<p>He took it very quietly: sent her a note
so cold and unconcerned that Camilla was
quite upset, and cried most of the evening,
and got up next day with swollen eyelids
and a very bad temper. She was not so
sure of her power as she had been&mdash;and the
loss of such a certainty is never pleasant.</p>

<p>He, meanwhile, advertised for a furnished
house, and found one&mdash;by letter, which
seemed to be the very thing he wanted.
&ldquo;Handsomely and conveniently furnished
five miles from a railway station&mdash;a well-built
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
house standing in its own grounds of
five acres&mdash;garden, orchard pasture, magnificent
view.&rdquo; Being as unversed in the ways
of house agents as in those of women, he
took it on trust, paid a quarter&rsquo;s rent, and
went down to take possession. He had
instructed the local house agent to find a
woman who would come in for a few hours
daily to &ldquo;do for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have no silly women living in the
house,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>It was on an inclement June evening that
the station fly set him down in front of his
new house. The drive had been long and
dreary, and seemed to Maurice more like
seventy miles than seven. Now he let down
the carriage window and thrust his head into
the rain to see his new house. It was a stucco
villa, with iron railings in the worst possible
taste. It had an air at once new and worn
out; no one seemed ever to have lived in it,
and yet everything about it was broken and
shabby. The door stuck a little at first with
the damp, and when at last it opened and
Maurice went over his house, he found it
furnished mainly with oil-cloth and three-legged
tables, and photographs in Oxford
frames&mdash;like a seaside lodging-house. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
house was clean, however, and the woman
in attendance was clean, but the atmosphere
of the place was that of a vault. He looked
out through the streaming panes at the
magnificent view so dwelt upon in the house
agents&rsquo; letters. The house stood almost at
the edge of a disused chalk quarry; far
below stretched a flat plain, dotted here
and there with limekilns and smoky, tall
chimneys. The five acres looked very bare
and thistly, and the rain was dripping heavily
from a shivering, half-dead cypress on to a
draggled, long-haired grass plot. Mr Brent
shivered too, and ordered a fire.</p>

<p>When the woman had gone, he sat long
by the fire in one of those cane and wood
chairs that fold up&mdash;who wants a chair to
fold up?&mdash;so common in lodging-houses.
Unless you sit quite straight in these chairs
you tumble out of them. He gazed at the
fire, and thought, and dreamed. His dreams
were, naturally, of Camilla; his thoughts
were of his work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken the house for three years,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;Well, one place is as good as
another to be wretched in. But one room
I must furnish&mdash;for you can&rsquo;t work on oil-cloth.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
So next day he walked to Rochester and
bought some old bureaux, and chairs, and
book-cases, a few Persian rugs and some
brass things, unpacked his books and settled
down to the hermit&rsquo;s life to which he had
vowed himself. The woman came every
morning from her cottage a mile away, and
left at noon. He got his meals himself&mdash;always
chops, or steaks, or eggs&mdash;and presently
began to grow accustomed to the place.
When the sun shone it was not so bad.
He could make no way against the thorns
and thistles on his five acres, and they quickly
grew into a very wilderness. But a wilderness
is pleasant to wander in; and a few flowers
had survived long neglect, and here and there
put out red, or white, or yellow buds. And
he worked away at his book about Greek
poetry.</p>

<p>He almost believed that he was contented;
he had never cared for people so much as
for books, and now he saw no people, and
his books began to crowd his shelves. No
one passed by &ldquo;The Yews&rdquo;&mdash;so called, he
imagined, in extravagant compliment to the
decaying cypress&mdash;for it stood by a grass-grown
by-way that had once connected two
main roads, each a couple of miles distant.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
These were now joined by a better road
down in the valley, and no one came past
Maurice&rsquo;s window save the milk, the bread,
the butcher, and the postman.</p>

<p>Summer turned brown and dry and became
autumn, autumn turned wet and chilly and
grew into winter, and all the winds of heaven
blew cold and damp through the cracks of the
ill-built house.</p>

<p>Maurice was glad when the spring came;
he had taken the house for three years, and
he was a careful man, and also, in his way,
a determined. Yet it was good to look out
once more on something green, and to see
sunshine and a warm sky; it was near Easter
now. In all these ten months nothing whatever
had happened to him. He had never
been beyond his five acres&mdash;and no one had
been to see him. He had no relations, and
friends soon forget; besides, after all, friends,
unlike relations, cannot go where they are not
invited.</p>

<p>It was on the Saturday before Easter that
the quarryside fell in. Maurice was working
in his study when he heard a sudden crack
and a slow, splitting sound, and then a long,
loud, rumbling noise, like thunder, that echoed
and re-echoed from the hills on each side.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
And, looking from his window, he saw the
cloud of white dust rise high above the edge
of the old quarry, and seem to drift off to
join the cotton-wool clouds in the blue sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s all safe enough here,&rdquo; he
said, and went back to his manuscripts. But
he could not work. At last something had
happened; he found himself shaken and
excited. He laid down the pen. &ldquo;I wonder
if any one was hurt?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the road
runs just below, of course. I wonder whether
there&rsquo;ll be any more of it&mdash;I wonder?&rdquo; A
wire jerked, the cracked bell sounded harshly
through the silence of the house. He sprang
to his feet. &ldquo;Who on earth&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;The house isn&rsquo;t safe after all, perhaps, and
they&rsquo;ve come to tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he went along the worn oil-cloth of the
hall he saw through the comfortless white-spotted
glass of his front door the outline of
a woman&rsquo;s hat.</p>

<p>He opened the door&mdash;it stuck as usual&mdash;but
he got it open. There stood a girl holding a
bicycle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said, without looking at him,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry to trouble you&mdash;my bicycle&rsquo;s
run down&mdash;and I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s a puncture,
and could you let me have some water, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
find the hole&mdash;and if I might sit down a
minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice grew lower and lower.</p>

<p>He opened the door wide and put out his
hand for the bicycle. She took two steps
past him, rather unsteadily, and sat down
on the stairs&mdash;there were no chairs: the
furniture of the hall was all oil-cloth and hat
pegs.</p>

<p>He saw now that she was very pale; her
face looked greenish behind her veil&rsquo;s white
meshes.</p>

<p>He propped the machine against the door,
as she leaned her head back against the ugly
marbled paper of the staircase wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re ill,&rdquo; he said gently. But
the girl made no answer. Her head slipped
along the varnished wall and rested on the
stair two steps above where she sat. Her
hat was crooked and twisted; even a student
of Greek could see that she had fainted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh Lord!&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>He got her hat and veil off&mdash;he never knew
how, and he wondered afterwards at his own
cleverness, for there were many pins, long and
short; he fetched the cushion from his armchair
and put it under her head; he took off
her gloves and rubbed her hands and her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
forehead with vinegar, but her complexion
remained green, and she lay, all in a heap,
at the foot of his staircase.</p>

<p>Then he remembered that fainting people
should be laid flat and not allowed to lie
about in heaps at the foot of stairs, so he very
gently and gingerly picked the girl up in his
arms and carried her into his sitting-room.
Here he laid her on the ground&mdash;he had no
sofa&mdash;and sat beside her on the floor, patiently
fanning her with a copy of the <i>Athenæum</i>,
and watching the pinched, pallid face for some
sign of returning life. It came at last, in a
flutter of the eyelids, a long-drawn, gasping
breath. The Greek scholar rushed for whisky&mdash;brandy
he esteemed as a mere adjunct of
channel boats&mdash;lifted her head and held the
glass to her lips. The blood had come back
to her face in a rush of carnation; she drank&mdash;choked&mdash;drank&mdash;he
laid her head down and
her eyes opened. They were large, clear grey
eyes&mdash;very bewildered-looking just now&mdash;but
they and the clear red tint in cheeks and lips
transformed the face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gracious,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s pretty!
Pretty? she&rsquo;s beautiful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was. That such beauty should so easily
have hidden itself behind a green-tinted mask,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
with sunken eyelid, seemed a miracle to the
ingenuous bookworm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re better now,&rdquo; said he with feverish
banality. &ldquo;Give me your hands&mdash;so&mdash;now
can&mdash;yes, that&rsquo;s right&mdash;here, this chair is the
only comfortable one&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sank into the chair, and waved away
the more whisky which he eagerly proffered.
He stood looking at her with respectful
solicitude.</p>

<p>After a few moments she stretched her
arms like a sleepy child, yawned, and then
suddenly broke into laughter. It had a
strange sound. No one had laughed in that
house since the wet night when Mr Brent
took possession of it, and he had never been
able to bring himself to believe that any one
had ever laughed there before.</p>

<p>Then he remembered having heard that
women have hysterical fits as well as fainting
fits, and he said eagerly: &ldquo;Oh don&rsquo;t! It&rsquo;s all
right&mdash;you were faint&mdash;the heat or something&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I faint?&rdquo; she asked with interest.
&ldquo;I never fainted before. But&mdash;oh&mdash;yes&mdash;I
remember. It was rather horrible. The
quarry tumbled down almost on me, and I
just stopped short&mdash;in time&mdash;and I came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
round by this road because the other&rsquo;s stopped
up, and I was so glad when I saw the house.
Thank you so much; it must have been an
awful bother. I think I had better start
soon&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t; you&rsquo;re not fit to ride
alone yet,&rdquo; said he to himself. Aloud he
said: &ldquo;You said something about a puncture&mdash;when
you are better I&rsquo;ll mend it. And,
look here&mdash;have you had any lunch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll allow me.&rdquo; He left the
room, and presently returned with the tray
set for his own lunch; then he fetched from
the larder everything he could lay hands on:
half a cold chicken, some cold meat pudding,
a pot of jam, bottled beer. He set these
confusedly on the table. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;come and try to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very good of you to bother,&rdquo; she said,
a little surprise in her tone, for she had
expected &ldquo;lunch&rdquo; to be a set formal meal at
which some discreet female relative would
preside. &ldquo;But aren&rsquo;t you&mdash;don&rsquo;t you&mdash;do
you live alone, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, a woman comes in in the mornings.
I&rsquo;m sorry she&rsquo;s gone: she could have arranged
a better lunch for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
&ldquo;Better? why, it&rsquo;s lovely!&rdquo; said she, accepting
the situation with frank amusement, and
she gave a touch or two to the table to set
everything in its place.</p>

<p>Then they lunched together. He would
have served her standing, as one serves a
queen&mdash;but she laughed again, and he took
the place opposite her. During lunch they
talked.</p>

<p>After lunch they mended the punctured
tyre, and talked all the while; then it was
past three o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t go yet,&rdquo; he said then, daring
greatly for what seemed to him a great
stake. &ldquo;Let me make you some tea&mdash;I can,
I assure you&mdash;and let us see if the tyre holds
up&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the tyre is all right, thanks to your
cleverness&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said he desperately, &ldquo;take
pity on a poor hermit! I give you my
word, I have been here ten months and three
days, and I have not in that time spoken a
single word to any human being except my
bedmaker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if you want to talk to people why
did you begin being a hermit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I didn&rsquo;t, then.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well&mdash;now you know better, why don&rsquo;t
you come back and talk to people in the
ordinary way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was the first and last sign she gave
that the circumstances in which she found
herself with him were anything but ordinary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a book to finish,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Would
you like to have tea in the wilderness or
in here?&rdquo; He wisely took her consent
for granted this time, and his wisdom was
justified.</p>

<p>They had tea in the garden. The wilderness
blossomed like a rose, to Maurice&rsquo;s thinking.
In his mind he was saying over and over
again: &ldquo;How bored I must have been all
this time! How bored I must have been!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed to him that his mind was
opening, like a flower, and for the first time.
He had never talked so well, and he knew
it&mdash;all the seeds of thought, sown in those
long, lonely hours, bore fruit now. She
listened, she replied, she argued and debated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beautiful&mdash;and sensible,&rdquo; said Maurice
to himself. &ldquo;What a wonderful woman!&rdquo;
There was, besides, an alertness of mind, a
quick brightness of manner that charmed
him. Camilla had been languid and dreamy.</p>

<p>Suddenly she rose to her feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
&ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I have enjoyed
myself so much. You are an ideal host:
thank you a thousand times. Perhaps we
shall meet again some day, if you return to
the world. Do you know, we&rsquo;ve been talking
and wrangling for hours and hours and
never even thought of wondering what each
other&rsquo;s names are&mdash;I think we&rsquo;ve paid each
other a very magnificent compliment, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled and said: &ldquo;My name is Maurice
Brent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mine is Diana Redmayne. If it sounds
like somebody in the <i>Family Herald</i>, I can&rsquo;t
help it.&rdquo; He had wheeled the bicycle into
the road, and she had put on hat and gloves
and stood ready to mount before she said:
&ldquo;If you come back to the world I shall
almost certainly meet you. We seem to
know the same people; I&rsquo;ve heard your
name many times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From whom?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Among others,&rdquo; said she, with her foot
on the pedal, &ldquo;from my cousin Camilla.
Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he was left to stare down the road
after the swift flying figure.</p>

<p>Then he went back into the lonely little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
house, and about half-past twelve that night
he realised that he had done no work that
day, and that those hours which had not
been spent talking to Diana Redmayne, had
been spent in thinking about her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not because she&rsquo;s pretty and clever,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s not even because she&rsquo;s a
woman. It&rsquo;s because she&rsquo;s the only intelligent
human being I&rsquo;ve spoken to for nearly a
year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So day after day he went on thinking about
her.</p>

<p>It was three weeks later that the bell again
creaked and jangled, and again through the
spotted glass he saw a woman&rsquo;s hat. To his
infinite disgust and surprise, his heart began
to beat violently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I grow nervous, living all alone,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Confound this door! how it does stick&mdash;I
must have it planed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He got the door opened, and found himself
face to face with&mdash;Camilla.</p>

<p>He stepped back, and bowed gravely.</p>

<p>She looked more beautiful than ever&mdash;and
he looked at her, and wondered how he could
ever have thought her even passably pretty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you ask me in?&rdquo; she said timidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am all alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have only just
heard you&rsquo;re living here all alone, and I came
to say&mdash;Maurice&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry. I didn&rsquo;t know
you cared so much, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said, stopping the confession
as a good batsman stops a cricket ball.
&ldquo;Believe me, I&rsquo;ve not made myself a hermit
because of&mdash;all that. I had a book to write&mdash;that
was all. And&mdash;and it&rsquo;s very kind of
you to come and look me up, and I wish I
could ask you to come in, but&mdash;&mdash; And it&rsquo;s
nice of you to take an interest in an old
friend&mdash;you said you would, didn&rsquo;t you, in
the letter&mdash;and&mdash;I&rsquo;ve taken the advice you
gave me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean you&rsquo;ve fallen in love with
some one else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You remember what you said in your
letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some one nicer and worthier, I said,&rdquo;
returned Camilla blankly, &ldquo;but I never
thought&mdash;&mdash; And is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course she seems so to me,&rdquo; said he,
smiling at her to express friendly feeling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;good-bye&mdash;I wish you the best of
good fortune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You said that in your letter, too,&rdquo; said
he. &ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t tell even you that, until I
have told her,&rdquo; he smiled again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then good-bye,&rdquo; said Camilla shortly;
&ldquo;forgive me for troubling you so unnecessarily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He found himself standing by his door&mdash;and
Camilla on her bicycle sped down the
road, choking with tears of anger and mortification
and deep disappointment. Because she
knew now that she loved him as much as it
was in her to love any one, and because she,
who had humbled so many, had now at last
humbled herself&mdash;and to no purpose.</p>

<p>Maurice Brent left his door open and
wandered down across his five acres, filled
with amazement. Camilla herself had not
been more deeply astonished at the words he
had spoken than he had been. A moment
before he had not even thought that he was in
love, much less contemplated any confession
of it: and now seemingly without his will he
stood committed to this statement. Was it
true, or had he only said it to defend himself
against those advances of hers in which he
merely saw a new trap? He had said it in
defence&mdash;yes&mdash;but it was true, for all that;
this was the wonderful part of it. And so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
he walked in the wilderness, lost in wonder;
and as he walked he noted the bicycles that
passed his door&mdash;along his unfrequented
road, by ones and twos and threes&mdash;for this
was a Saturday, and the lower road was still
lying cold and hidden under its load of chalk,
and none might pass that way. This road
was hot and dusty, and folk went along it
continually. He strolled to his ugly iron
gate and looked over, idly. Perhaps, some
day, she would come that way again&mdash;she
would surely stop&mdash;especially if he were at
the gate&mdash;and perhaps stay and talk a little.
As if in mocking answer to the new-born
thought came a flash of blue along the road;
Diana Redmayne rode by at full speed&mdash;bowed
coldly&mdash;and then at ten yards&rsquo; distance
turned and waved a white-gloved hand, with
a charming smile. Maurice swore softly, and
went indoors to think.</p>

<p>His work went but slowly on that day&mdash;and
in the days that followed. On the next
Friday he went over to Rochester, and in
the dusk of the evening he walked along the
road, about a mile from &ldquo;The Yews,&rdquo; and
then, going slowly, he cast handfuls of something
dark from his hand, and kicked the
white dust over it as it lay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
&ldquo;I feel like the enemy sowing tares,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>Then he went home, full of anxious
anticipation. The next day was hot and
bright. He took his armchair into the
nightmare of a verandah, and sat there reading;
only above the top of the book his eyes
could follow the curve of the white road.
This made it more difficult to follow the text.
Presently the bicyclists began to go past, by
ones and twos and threes; but a certain
percentage was wheeling its machines&mdash;others
stopped within sight to blow up their tyres.
One man sat down under the hedge thirty
yards away, and took his machine to pieces;
presently he strolled up and asked for water.
Brent gave it, in a tin basin, grudgingly, and
without opening the gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I overdid it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a quarter of a
pound would have been enough; yet I don&rsquo;t
know&mdash;perhaps it&rsquo;s well to be on the safe side.
Yet three pounds was perhaps excessive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon a pink figure wheeling
a bicycle came slowly down the road. He
sat still, and tried to read. In a moment
he should hear the click of the gate: then
he would spring up and be very much
astonished. But the gate did not click, and
when next he raised his eyes the pink blouse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
had gone by, and was almost past the end
of the five acres. Then he did spring up&mdash;and
ran.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Redmayne, can&rsquo;t I help you? What
is it? Have you had a spill?&rdquo; he said as
he overtook her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Puncture,&rdquo; said she laconically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very unfortunate. Mayn&rsquo;t I help
you to mend it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mend it as soon as I get to a shady
place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come into the wilderness. See&mdash;here&rsquo;s
the side gate. I&rsquo;ll fetch some water in a
moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him doubtfully, and then
consented. She refused tea, but she stayed
and talked till long after the bicycle was
mended.</p>

<p>On the following Saturday he walked
along the road, and back, and along, and
again the place was alive with angry cyclists
dealing, each after his fashion, with a
punctured tyre. He came upon Miss
Redmayne sitting by the ditch mending
hers. That was the time when he sat on
the roadside and told her all about himself&mdash;reserving
only those points where his life
had touched Camilla&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
The week after he walked the road again,
and this time he overtook Miss Redmayne,
who was resolutely wheeling her bicycle
back in the way by which she had come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me wheel it for you,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Whither bound?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back to Rochester,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I generally ride over to see my aunts at
Felsenden on Saturdays, but I fear I must
give it up, or go by train; this road isn&rsquo;t
safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not safe?&rdquo; he said with an agitation
which could not escape her notice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not safe,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Mr Brent,
there is a very malicious person in this
part of the country&mdash;a perfectly dreadful
person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he managed to
ask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These three Saturdays I have come along
this road; each time I have had a puncture.
And each time I have found embedded in
my tyre the evidence of some one&rsquo;s malice.
This is one piece of evidence.&rdquo; She held
out her ungloved hand. On its pink palm
lay a good sized tin-tack. &ldquo;Once might be
accident; twice a coincidence; three times
is too much. The road&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
&ldquo;Do you think some one did it on
purpose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; she said calmly.</p>

<p>Then he grew desperate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try to forgive me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was
so lonely, and I wanted so much&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned wide eyes on him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; she cried, and began to laugh.</p>

<p>Her laughter was very pretty, he thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you didn&rsquo;t know it was me?&rdquo; said
the Greek student.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; she said again. &ldquo;And has it
amused you&mdash;to see all these poor people
in difficulties, and to know that you&rsquo;ve spoilt
their poor little holiday for them&mdash;and three
times, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never thought about <i>them</i>,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;it was you I wanted to see. Try to forgive
me; you don&rsquo;t know how much I wanted
you.&rdquo; Something in his voice kept her silent.
&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t laugh,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I feel
as if I wanted nothing in the world but
you. Let me come to see you&mdash;let me try
to make you care too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking nonsense,&rdquo; she said, for he
stopped on a note that demanded an answer.
&ldquo;Why, you told Camilla&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;but you&mdash;but I meant <i>you</i>. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
thought I cared about her once&mdash;but I never
cared really with all my heart and soul for
any one but you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him calmly and earnestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to forget all this,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;but I like you very much, and if you
want to come and see me, you may. I will
introduce you to my aunts at Felsenden as&mdash;as
a friend of Camilla&rsquo;s. And I will be
friends with you; but nothing else ever.
Do you care to know my aunts?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maurice had inspirations of sense sometimes.
One came to him now, and he said:
&ldquo;I care very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then help me to mend my bicycle, and
you can call there to-morrow. It&rsquo;s &lsquo;The
Grange&rsquo;&mdash;you can&rsquo;t miss it. No, not another
word of nonsense, please, or we can&rsquo;t possibly
be friends.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>He helped her to mend the bicycle, and
they talked of the beauty of spring and of
modern poetry.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It was at &ldquo;The Grange,&rdquo; Felsenden, that
Maurice next saw Miss Redmayne&mdash;and it
was from &ldquo;The Grange,&rdquo; Felsenden, that, in
September, he married her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
&ldquo;And why did you say you would never,
never be anything but a friend?&rdquo; he asked her
on the day when that marriage was arranged.
&ldquo;Oh! you nearly made me believe you!
Why did you say it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One must say something!&rdquo; she answered.
&ldquo;Besides, you&rsquo;d never have respected me if
I&rsquo;d said &lsquo;yes&rsquo; at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you have said it? Did you like
me then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him, and her look was an
answer. He stooped and gravely kissed her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you really cared, even then? I wish
you had been braver,&rdquo; he said a little sadly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you
then&mdash;you must try to forgive me, dear.
Think how much there was at stake!
Suppose I had lost you!&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="padtop smlpadb">VII<br />
<br />
THE AUNT AND THE EDITOR</h2>


<p>Aunt Kate was the great comfort of
Kitty&rsquo;s existence. Always kindly, helpful,
sympathetic, no girlish trouble was too slight,
no girlish question too difficult for her tender
heart&mdash;her delicate insight. How different
from grim Aunt Eliza, with whom it was
Kitty&rsquo;s fate to live. Aunt Eliza was severe,
methodical, energetic. In household matters
she spared neither herself nor her niece.
Kitty could darn and mend and bake and
dust and sweep in a way which might have
turned the parents of the bluest Girtonian
green with envy. She had read a great deal,
too&mdash;the really solid works that are such a
nuisance to get through, and that leave a
mark on one&rsquo;s mind like the track of a steamroller.
That was Aunt Eliza&rsquo;s doing. Kitty
ought to have been grateful&mdash;but she wasn&rsquo;t.
She didn&rsquo;t want to be improved with solid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
books. She wanted to write books herself.
She did write little tales when her aunt was
out on business, which was often, and she
dreamed of the day when she should write
beautiful books, poems, romances. These
Aunt Eliza classed roughly as &ldquo;stuff and
nonsense&rdquo;; and one day, when she found
Kitty reading the <i>Girls&rsquo; Very Own Friend</i>,
she tore that harmless little weekly across and
across and flung it into the fire. Then she
faced Kitty with flushed face and angry eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I ever catch you bringing such rubbish
into the house again, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll stop your music
lessons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was a horrible threat. Kitty went
twice a week to the Guildhall School of
Music. She had no musical talent whatever,
but the journey to London and back was her
one glimpse of the world&rsquo;s tide that flowed
outside the neat, gloomy, ordered house at
Streatham. Therefore Kitty was careful that
Aunt Eliza should not again &ldquo;catch her
bringing such rubbish into the house.&rdquo; But
she went on reading the paper all the same,
just as she went on writing her little stories.
And presently she got one of her little stories
typewritten, and sent it to the <i>Girls&rsquo; Very
Own Friend</i>. It was a silly little story&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
heroine was <i>svelte</i>, I am sorry to say, and
had red-gold hair and a soft, <i>trainante</i> voice&mdash;and
the hero was a &ldquo;frank-looking young
Englishman, with a bronzed face and honest
blue eyes.&rdquo; The plot was that with which
I firmly believe every career of fiction begins&mdash;the
girl who throws over her lover because
he has jilted her friend. Then she finds out
that it was not her lover, but his brother or
cousin. We have all written this story in
our time, and Kitty wrote it much worse than
many, but not nearly so badly as most of
us.</p>

<p>And the <i>Girls&rsquo; Very Own Friend</i> accepted
the story and printed it, and in its columns
notified to &ldquo;George Thompson&rdquo; that the
price, a whole guinea, was lying idle at the
office till he should send his address. For,
of course, Kitty had taken a man&rsquo;s name for
her pen-name, and almost equally, of course,
had called herself &ldquo;George.&rdquo; George Sand
began it, and it is a fashion which young
authors seem quite unable to keep themselves
from following.</p>

<p>Kitty longed to tell some one of her success&mdash;to
ask admiration and advice; but Aunt
Eliza was more severe and less approachable
than usual that week. She was busy writing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
letters. She had always a sheaf of dull-looking
letters to answer, so Kitty could
only tell Mary in the kitchen under vows
of secrecy, and Mary in the kitchen only
said: &ldquo;Well, to be sure, Miss, it&rsquo;s beautiful!
I suppose you wrote the story down out of
some book?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Therefore Kitty felt that it was vain to
apply to her for intellectual sympathy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will write to Aunt Kate,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;<i>she</i> will understand. Oh, how I wish I
could see her! She must be a dear, soft,
pussy, cuddly sort of person. Why shouldn&rsquo;t
I go and see her? I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And on this desperate resolve she acted.</p>

<p>Now I find it quite impossible any longer
to conceal from the intelligent reader that
the reason why Kitty had never seen Aunt
Kate was that &ldquo;Aunt Kate&rdquo; was merely
the screen which sheltered from a vulgar
publicity the gifted person who wrote the
&ldquo;Answers to Correspondents&rdquo; for the <i>Girls&rsquo;
Very Own Friend</i>.</p>

<p>In fear and trembling, and a disguised
hand-writing; with a feigned name and a
quickly-beating heart, Kitty, months before,
had written to this mysterious and gracious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
being. In the following week&rsquo;s number had
appeared these memorable lines:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sweet Nancy.</i>&mdash;So pleased, dear, with
your little letter. Write to me quite freely.
I love to help my girls.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>So Kitty wrote quite freely, and as honestly
as any girl of eighteen ever writes: her
hopes and fears, her household troubles, her
literary ambitions. And in the columns of
the <i>Girls&rsquo; Very Own Friend</i> Aunt Kate
replied with all the tender grace and
delightful warmth that characterised her
utterances.</p>

<p>The idea of calling on Aunt Kate occurred
to Kitty as she was &ldquo;putting on her things&rdquo;
to go to the Guildhall. She instantly threw
the plain &ldquo;everyday&rdquo; hat from her, and pulled
her best hat from its tissue-paper nest in the
black bandbox. She put on her best blouse&mdash;the
cream-coloured one with the browny
lace on it, and her best brown silk skirt.
She recklessly added her best brown shoes
and gloves, and the lace pussy-boa. (I don&rsquo;t
know what the milliner&rsquo;s name for the thing
is. It goes round the neck, and hangs its
soft and fluffy ends down nearly to one&rsquo;s
knees.) Then she looked at herself in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
glass, gave a few last touches to her hair
and veil, and nodded to herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do, my dear,&rdquo; said Kitty.</p>

<p>Aunt Eliza was providentially absent at Bath
nursing a sick friend, and the black-bugled
duenna, hastily imported from Tunbridge
Wells, could not be expected to know
which was Kitty&rsquo;s best frock, and which the
gloves that ought only to have been worn
at church.</p>

<p>When Kitty&rsquo;s music lesson was over,
she stood for a moment on the steps of
the Guildhall School, looking down towards
the river. Then she shrugged her pretty
shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. I&rsquo;m going to,&rdquo; she said,
and turned resolutely towards Tudor Street.
Kitty had been to a high school: therefore
she was not obviously shy. She asked her
way frankly and easily of carman, or clerk,
or errand-boy; and though, at the door of
the dingy office in a little court off Fleet
Street, her heart beat thickly as she read
the blue-enamelled words, <i>Girls&rsquo; Very Own
Friend</i>, her manner as she walked into the
office betrayed no nervousness, and, indeed,
struck the grinning idle office boy as that
of &ldquo;a bloomin&rsquo; duchess.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
&ldquo;I want to see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she began; and then
suddenly the awkwardness of her position
struck her. She did not know Aunt Kate&rsquo;s
surname. Abruptly to ask this grinning lout
for &ldquo;Aunt Kate&rdquo; seemed absolutely indecorous.
&ldquo;I want to see the editor,&rdquo; she
ended.</p>

<p>She waited in the grimy office while the
boy disappeared through an inner door,
marked in dingy white letters with the
magic words, &ldquo;Editor&mdash;Private.&rdquo; A low buzz
of voices came to her through the door. She
looked at the pigeon-holes where heaps of
back numbers of the <i>Girls&rsquo; Very Own</i> lay
in a dusty retirement. She looked at the
insurance company&rsquo;s tasteless almanack that
hung all awry on the wall, and still the buzz
went on. Then suddenly some one laughed
inside, and the laugh did not please Kitty.
The next moment the boy returned, grinning
more repulsively than ever, and said: &ldquo;Walk
this way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She walked that way, past the boy; the
door fell to behind her, and she found herself
in a cloud of tobacco smoke, compressed
into a small room&mdash;a very dusty, untidy room&mdash;in
which stood three young men. Their
faces were grave and serious, but Kate could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
not forget that one of them had laughed,
and laughed <i>like that</i>. Her chin went up
about a quarter of an inch further.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to have disturbed you,&rdquo; she
said severely. &ldquo;I wanted to see&mdash;to see the
lady who signs herself Aunt Kate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence which
seemed almost breathless. Two of the young
men exchanged a glance, but though Kitty
perceived it to be significant, she could not
interpret its meaning. Then one of the
three turned to gaze out of the window at
the blackened glass roof of the printing office
below. Kitty felt certain he was concealing
a smile; and the second hurriedly arranged
a bundle of papers beside him.</p>

<p>The third young man spoke, and Kitty liked
the gentle drawl, the peculiar enunciation.
The poor girl, in her Streatham seclusion,
had never before heard the &ldquo;Oxford voice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but &lsquo;Aunt
Kate&rsquo; is not here to-day. Perhaps&mdash;is there
anything I could do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said Kitty, wishing herself
miles away; the tobacco smoke choked
her, the backs of the two other men seemed
an outrage. She turned away with a haughty
bow, and went down the grimy stairs full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
of fury. She could have slapped herself.
How could she have been such a fool as to
come there? There were feet coming down
the stair behind her&mdash;she quickened her
pace. The feet came more quickly. She
stopped on the landing and turned with an
odd feeling of being at bay. It was the
fair-haired young man with the Oxford
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so very sorry,&rdquo; he said gently,
&ldquo;but I did not know. I did not expect to
see&mdash;I mean, I did not know who you were.
And we had all been smoking&mdash;I am so
sorry,&rdquo; he said again, rather lamely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; said Kitty, more shyly
than she had ever spoken in her life. She
liked his eyes and his voice as much as she
loathed the expressive backs of his two
companions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you could come again: perhaps Aunt
Kate will be here on Thursday. I know she
will be sorry to miss you,&rdquo; the young man
went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I won&rsquo;t call again, thank you,&rdquo;
said Kitty. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll write, thank you; it
is all right. I oughtn&rsquo;t to have come.
Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to stand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
back and let her pass. The editor went back
slowly to his room. His friends had relighted
their pipes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Appeased the outraged goddess?&rdquo; asked
one of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good old Aunt Kate!&rdquo; said the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut up, Sellars!&rdquo; said the editor,
frowning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, which of your correspondents is it?&rdquo;
pondered Sellars, ruffling the bundle of papers
in his hand. &ldquo;Is it &lsquo;Wild Woodbine,&rsquo; who
wants to know what will make her hands
white? Chilcott, did you see her hands?
Oh no, of course&mdash;<i>bien chaussée, bien gantée</i>.
All brown, too. Is it &lsquo;Sylph&rsquo;?&mdash;no; she
wants a pattern for a Zouave. What is a
Zouave, if you please, Mr Editor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dry up!&rdquo; said the editor, but Sellars was
busy with the papers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eureka! I know her. She&rsquo;s &lsquo;Nut-brown
Maid&rsquo;&mdash;here&rsquo;s the letter&mdash;wants to know if
she may talk to &lsquo;a young gentleman she has
not been properly introduced to&rsquo;&mdash;spells it
&lsquo;interoduced,&rsquo; too&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The editor snatched the papers out of the
other&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now clear out,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m busy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I dreaming?&rdquo; said Sellars pensively;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
&ldquo;or is this the editor who invited us to
collaborate with him in his &lsquo;Answers to
Correspondents&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the editor who will kick you down
the entire five flights if he is driven to it.
You won&rsquo;t drive him, will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two laughed, but they took up their
hats and went; Sellars put his head round
the door for a last word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What price love at first sight?&rdquo; said he,
and the office ruler dented the door as he
disappeared round it. The editor, left alone,
sat down in his chair and looked helplessly
round him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he said musingly, &ldquo;well, well,
well, well!&rdquo; Then after a long silence he
took up his pen and began the &ldquo;Answers to
Correspondents.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dieu-donnée.</i>&mdash;Your hair is a very nice
colour. I should not advise Aureoline.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Shy Fairy.</i>&mdash;By all means consult your
mother. Heliotrope would suit your complexion,
if it is, as you say, of a brilliant
fairness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Contadina.</i>&mdash;No, I should not advise
scarlet velvet with the pale blue. Try myrtle
green.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Presently he threw down the pen. &ldquo;I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
suppose I shall never see her again,&rdquo; he said,
and he actually sighed.</p>

<p>But he did see her again. For on her
way home poor Kitty&rsquo;s imagination suddenly
spread its wings and alighted accurately on the
truth; she formed a sufficiently vivid picture
of what had happened in the office after she
left. She <i>knew</i> that those other young men&mdash;&ldquo;the
pigs,&rdquo; she called them to herself&mdash;had
speculated as to whether she was &ldquo;Little
One,&rdquo; who wanted to make her hair curl,
and to know whether short waists would be
worn; or &ldquo;Moss Rose,&rdquo; who was anxious
about her complexion, and the proper way
to treat a jibbing sweetheart. So that very
night she wrote a note to Aunt Kate, but
she did not sign it &ldquo;Sweet Nancy&rdquo; in the
old manner, and she did not disguise her
hand. She signed it George Thompson, in
inverted commas, and she said that she would
call on Thursday.</p>

<p>And on Thursday she called. And was
shown into the editor&rsquo;s room at once.</p>

<p>The editor rose to greet her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Kate is not here,&rdquo; said he hurriedly;
&ldquo;but if you can spare a few moments I
should like to talk to you about business;
I did not know the other day that you were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
the author of that charming story &lsquo;Evelyn&rsquo;s
Error.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The room was clear of tobacco smoke&mdash;the
editor was alone&mdash;some red roses lay on
the table. Kitty caught herself wondering
for whom he had bought them. The chair he
offered her was carefully dusted. She took
it&mdash;and he began to talk about her story;
criticising, praising, blaming, and that so skilfully
that criticism seemed a subtle flattery,
and the very blame conveyed a compliment.
Then he asked for more stories. And a new
heaven and a new earth seemed to unroll
before the girl&rsquo;s eyes. If she could only
write&mdash;and succeed&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you come again?&rdquo; he said at last.
&ldquo;Aunt Kate&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, with eyes shining softly,
&ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t matter about Aunt Kate now!
I shall be so busy trying to write stories.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fact is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said the editor slowly,
racking his brains for a reason that should
bring her to the office again&mdash;&ldquo;the fact is&mdash;<i>I</i>
am Aunt Kate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kitty sprang to her feet. Her face flamed
scarlet. She stood silent a moment. Then:
&ldquo;<i>You?</i>&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s <i>not</i> fair&mdash;it&rsquo;s
mean&mdash;it&rsquo;s shameful! Oh&mdash;how could you!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
And girls write to <i>you</i>&mdash;and they think it&rsquo;s
a woman&mdash;and they tell you about their
troubles. It&rsquo;s horrible! It&rsquo;s underhand&mdash;it&rsquo;s
abominable! I hate you for it. Every one
ought to know. I shall write to the papers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, please,&rdquo; said the editor hurriedly
and humbly&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s not my fault. It <i>is</i> a
lady who does it generally, but she had to
go away&mdash;and I couldn&rsquo;t get any one else
to do it. And I didn&rsquo;t see&mdash;till after you&rsquo;d
been the other day&mdash;that it wasn&rsquo;t fair. And
I was going to ask if <i>you</i> would do it&mdash;the
correspondence, I mean&mdash;just for this week.
I wish you would!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could I?&rdquo; she said doubtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you could! And if you&rsquo;d
bring the copy on Monday&mdash;about two
columns, you know&mdash;we could go through
it together and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; said Kitty abruptly,
reaching out for the sheaf of letters which
he was gathering together.</p>

<p>And now who was happier than Kitty,
seated behind her locked bedroom door
advising &ldquo;Dieu-donnée&rdquo; and &ldquo;Shy Fairy&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Contadina&rdquo; out of the unfathomable
depths of her girlish inexperience. Her
advice looked wonderfully practical, though,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
in print, she thought, as with a thrill of pride
and joy she corrected the first proofs. And
she wrote stories, too, and they, too, were
printed. It was indeed a bright and beautiful
world. Aunt Eliza stayed away for five
glorious weeks. Kitty, with an enthralling
sense of reckless wickedness, gave up her
useless music lessons, and in going three
times a week to the office experienced a
glowing consciousness of the joy and dignity
of honest toil.</p>

<p>The editor, by the way, during these five
weeks fell in love with Kitty, exactly as he
had known he would do when first he saw
her grey eyes. Kitty had never been so
happy in all her life. The child honestly
believed hers to be the happiness that comes
from congenial work. And her editor was
so clever and so kind! No one ever smoked
in the office now, and there were always
roses. And Kitty took them home with
her, so that now there was no need to wonder
for whom he had bought them.</p>

<p>Then came the inevitable hour. He met
her one day with a clouded face and a letter
in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the real original
old Aunt Kate is coming back. She&rsquo;s the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
dearest old thing, so kind and jolly&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;whatever
shall we do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can still write stories, I suppose,&rdquo;
said Kitty, but she realised with a gasp that
congenial toil would not be quite, quite
the same without congenial companionship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, picking up the bunch of
red roses, &ldquo;but&mdash;here are your flowers&mdash;don&rsquo;t
you know yet that I can&rsquo;t possibly do
without you? In a few months I&rsquo;m to
have the editorship of a new weekly, a
much better berth than this. If only you
would&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Write the correspondence?&rdquo; said Kitty,
brightening; &ldquo;of course I will. I don&rsquo;t know
what I should do without&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; he interrupted, &ldquo;that I could
think it was <i>me</i> you couldn&rsquo;t do without.&rdquo;
Her pretty eyes met his over the red roses,
and he caught her hands with the flowers
in them. &ldquo;Is it? Oh, say you can&rsquo;t do
without me either. Say it, say it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t want to do without you,&rdquo;
said Kitty at last. He was holding her hands
fast, and she was trying, not very earnestly,
perhaps, to pull them away. The pair made
a pretty picture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty!&rdquo; he said softly,
and then the door opened, and suddenly,
without the least warning, a middle-aged
lady became a spectator of the little tableau.
The newcomer wore a mantle with beads
on it, a black bonnet wherein nodded a
violet flower&mdash;and beads and flower and
bonnet were absolutely familiar to each of
the astonished ones now standing consciously
with the breadth of the office between them.
For in that middle-aged lady the editor
recognised Aunt Kate, the pleasant, sensible,
companionable woman who for years had
written those sympathetic &ldquo;Answers to
Correspondents&rdquo; in the <i>Girls&rsquo; Very Own
Friend</i>. And at the same moment Kitty
recognised, beyond all possibility of doubt,
Aunt Eliza&mdash;her own grim, harsh, uncongenial
Aunt Eliza.</p>

<p>Kitty cowered&mdash;in her frightened soul
she cowered. But her little figure drew
itself up, and the point of her chin rose a
quarter of an inch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Eliza,&rdquo; she said firmly, &ldquo;I know
you will&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Your Aunt Eliza</i>, Kitty?&rdquo; cried the
editor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Kitty&rsquo;?&rdquo; said the aunt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
And now the situation hung all too nicely
balanced on the extreme edge of the absolutely
impossible. Would this middle-aged
lady&mdash;an aunt beyond doubt&mdash;an aunt who
so long had played a double <i>rôle</i>, assume,
now that one <i>rôle</i> must be chosen, the part
of Aunt Eliza the Terrible or of Aunt Kate
the Kind? The aunt was dumb. Kitty was
dumb. But the editor had his wits about
him, and Kate, though shaken, was not
absolutely paralysed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost too good to be true,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;that <i>my</i> Aunt Kate is really <i>your</i> Aunt
Eliza. Aunt Kate, Kitty and I have just
decided that we can&rsquo;t do without each other.
I am so glad that you are the first to wish
us joy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At his words all the &ldquo;Kate&rdquo; in the
aunt rose triumphant, trampling down the
&ldquo;Eliza.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; she said&mdash;and she said it
in a voice which Kitty had never heard before&mdash;the
sound of that voice drew Kitty like a
magnet. She did the only possible thing&mdash;she
put her arms timidly round her aunt&rsquo;s
neck and whispered: &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be Aunt
Eliza any more, be Aunt Kate!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Aunt Kate&rsquo;s arms undoubtedly that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
went round the girl. Certainly not Aunt
Eliza&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will take a walk down Fleet Street,&rdquo;
said the editor discreetly.</p>

<p>Then there were explanations in the office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why,&rdquo; said Kitty, when all the
questions had been asked and answered, &ldquo;why
were you Aunt Eliza to me, and Aunt Kate
to him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, one must spoil somebody, and
I was determined not to spoil <i>you</i>; I wanted
to save you. All my life was ruined because
I was a spoiled child&mdash;and because I tried to
write. I had such dreams, such ambitions&mdash;just
like yours, you silly child! But then I
was never clever&mdash;perhaps you may be&mdash;and
it all ended in my losing my lover. He
married a nice, quiet, domestic girl, and I
never made name or fame at all&mdash;I never
got anything taken but fashion articles&mdash;and
&lsquo;Answers to Correspondents.&rsquo; Now, that&rsquo;s
the whole tale. Don&rsquo;t mention it again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you did love me, even when&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I did,&rdquo; said Aunt Kate in the
testy tones of Aunt Eliza; &ldquo;or why should
I have bothered at all about whether you
were going to be happy or not? Now,
Kitty, you&rsquo;re not to expect me to gush.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
I&rsquo;ve forgotten how to be sentimental except
on paper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be sentimental,&rdquo; said
Kitty, a little injured, &ldquo;neither does&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the editor came in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to be sentimental either,&rdquo;
Kitty went on; &ldquo;do you&mdash;Mr Editor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The editor looked a little doubtful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to be happy, at any rate,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;and I mean to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he can&rsquo;t be happy unless you smile
on him. Smile on him, Auntie!&rdquo; cried a
new, radiant Kitty, to whom aunts no longer
presented any terrors. &ldquo;Say &lsquo;Bless you, my
children!&rsquo; Auntie&mdash;do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get along with your nonsense!&rdquo; said
Aunt Eliza. Or was it Aunt Kate?</p>

<h2 class="padtop smlpadb">VIII<br />
<br />
MISS MOUSE</h2>


<p>They were poor, not with the desperate
poverty that has to look on both sides of a
penny, but with the decent bearable poverty
that must look at a shilling with attention,
and with respect at half-a-crown. There was
money for the necessities of life, the mother
said, but no money to waste. This was what
she always tried to say when Maisie came in
with rainbow representations of the glories
of local &ldquo;sales&rdquo; piteous pictures of beautiful
things going almost for nothing&mdash;things not
absolutely needed, but which would &ldquo;come
in useful.&rdquo; Maisie&rsquo;s dress was never allowed
those touches of cheap finery which would
have made it characteristic of her. Her
clothes were good, and she had to patch
and mend and contrive so much that sometimes
it seemed to her as though all her life
was going by in the effort to achieve, by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
distasteful process, a result which she abhorred.
For her artistic sense was too weak to show
her how the bright, soft freshness of her tints
gained by contrast with the dull greys and
browns and drabs that were her mother&rsquo;s
choice&mdash;good wearing colours, from which
the pink and white of her face rose triumphantly,
like a beautiful flower out of a rough
calyx.</p>

<p>The house was like Maisie, in that it never
seemed to have anything new&mdash;none of those
bright, picturesque cushions and screens and
Japaneseries which she adored through the
plate-glass windows of the big local draper.
The curtains were of old damask, faded but
rich; the furniture was mahogany, old and
solid; the carpets were Turkey and Aubusson&mdash;patched
and darned this last, but still
beautiful. Maisie knew all about old oak&mdash;she
had read her <i>Home Hints</i> and her
<i>Gentlewoman&rsquo;s Guide</i>&mdash;but she had no idea
that mahogany could be fashionable. None
of the photographs of the drawing-rooms of
celebrities in her favourite papers were anything
like the little sitting-room where her
mother sat knitting by the hearth, surrounded
by the relics of a house that had been handsome
in the &rsquo;sixties, when it was her girlhood&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
home. Maisie hated it all: the chairs covered
in Berlin-wool needlework, the dark, polished
surfaces of the tables and bureaux, the tinkling
lustres of Bohemian glass, the shining brass
trivet on which the toast kept itself warm,
the crude colours of the tea-service, the smell
of eau-de-Cologne mingling with the faint
scent of beeswax and cedar-wood. She would
have liked to change the old water-colours in
their rubbed gilt frames for dark-mounted
autotypes. How should she know that those
hideous pigs were Morlands, and that the
cow picture was a David Cox. She would
have liked Japanese blue transfers instead of
the gold-and-white china&mdash;old Bristol, by
the way, but Maisie knew nothing of Bristol.
The regular, sober orderliness of the house
chafed and fretted her; the recurrent duties,
all dull; the few guests who came to tea.
Decent poverty cannot give dinner parties
or dances. She visited her school friends,
and when she came home again it seemed
to her sometimes as though the atmosphere
of the place would choke her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to go out and earn my own living,&rdquo;
she said to her cousin Edward one Sunday
afternoon when her mother was resting and
he and she were roasting chestnuts on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
bars of the dining-room fire. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m simply
useless here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edward was a second cousin. To him the
little house was the ideal home, just as Maisie
was&mdash;well, not, perhaps, the ideal girl, but
the only girl in the world, which comes to
much the same thing. But he never told
her so: he dared not risk losing the cousin&rsquo;s
place and missing for ever the lover&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>So, in his anxiety lest she should know
how much he cared, he scolded her a good
deal. But he took her to picture galleries
and to <i>matinées</i>, and softened her life in a
hundred ways that she never noticed. He
was only &ldquo;Poor old Edward,&rdquo; and he knew it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why, what
on earth would Aunt do without you? Here,
have this one&mdash;it&rsquo;s a beauty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ought to have been taught a trade, like
other poor girls,&rdquo; she went on, waving away
the roasted chestnut. &ldquo;Lots of the girls I
was at school with are earning as much as
a pound a week now&mdash;typewriting or painting
birthday cards, and some of them are in
the Post Office&mdash;and I do nothing but drudge
away at home. It&rsquo;s too bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edward would have given a decent sum at
that moment to be inspired with exactly the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
right thing to say. As it was he looked at
her helplessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never do,&rdquo; she answered crossly.
There was a silence in which she felt the
growth of a need to justify herself&mdash;to herself
as well as to him. &ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo;
she urged, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s my plain duty to go out and
earn something. Why, we&rsquo;re as poor as ever
we can be&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t any pocket-money hardly&mdash;I
can&rsquo;t even buy presents for people. I
have to <i>make</i> presents out of odds and ends
of old things, instead of buying them, like
other girls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you make awfully pretty things,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;much prettier than any one can
buy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re thinking of that handkerchief-case
I gave Aunt Emma at Christmas. Why,
you silly, it was only a bit of one of mother&rsquo;s
old dresses. I do wish you&rsquo;d talk to mother
about it. I might go out as companion or
something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The word came before the thought, but
the thought was brought by the word and
the thought stayed.</p>

<p>That very evening Maisie began to lay
siege to her mother&rsquo;s desired consent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
She put her arguments very neatly, so
neatly that it was hard for the mother to
oppose them without being betrayed into an
attitude that would seem grossly selfish.</p>

<p>She sat looking into the fire, thinking of
all the little, unceasing sacrifices that had
been her life ever since Maisie had been hers&mdash;even
the giving up of that treasured silk, her
wedding dress, last Christmas, because Maisie
wanted something pretty to make Christmas
presents out of. She remembered it all; and
now this new great sacrifice was called for.
She had given up to Maisie everything but her
taste in dress, and now it seemed that she
was desired to give up even Maisie herself.
But the other sacrifices had been for Maisie&rsquo;s
good or for her pleasure. Would this one
be for either?</p>

<p>She saw her little girl alone among strangers,
snubbed, looked down upon, a sort of upper
servant with none of a servant&rsquo;s privileges;
she nerved herself to what was always to her
an almost unbearable effort. Her heart was
beating and her hands trembling as she said:
&ldquo;My dear, it&rsquo;s quite impossible; I couldn&rsquo;t
possibly allow it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must say I don&rsquo;t see why,&rdquo; said Maisie,
with tears in her voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
Her mother dropped the mass of fleecy
white wool and the clinking knitting needles
and grasped the arms of her chair intensely.
Her eyes behind the spectacles clouded with
tears. It seemed to her that her child should
surely understand the agony it was to her
mother to refuse her anything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could earn money for you&mdash;it&rsquo;s not
myself I&rsquo;m thinking about,&rdquo; the girl went
on; the half-lie came out quite without
her conscious volition. &ldquo;I wish you didn&rsquo;t
always think I do everything for selfish
reasons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, my dear,&rdquo; said the mother feebly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s my duty,&rdquo; Maisie went on,
with more tears than ever in her voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
eighteen, and I ought to be earning something,
instead of being a burden to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mother looked hopelessly into the fire.
She had always tried to explain things to
Maisie; how was it that Maisie never understood?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Maisie, echoing her mother&rsquo;s
thought, &ldquo;I always try to tell you how I
think about things, and you never seem to
understand. Of course, I won&rsquo;t go if you
wish it, but I <i>do</i> think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She left the room in tears, and the mother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
remained to torment herself with the eternal
questions, What had she done wrong? Why
was Maisie not contented? What could she
do to please her? Would nothing please her
but the things that were not for her good&mdash;smart
clothes, change, novelty? How could
she bear her life if Maisie was not pleased?</p>

<p>She went down to supper shivering with
misery and apprehension. What a meal it
would be with Maisie cold and aloof, polite
and indifferent! But Maisie was cheerful,
gay almost, and her mother felt a passion of
gratitude to her daughter for not being sulky
or unapproachable. Maisie, however, was
only stepping back to jump the better.</p>

<p>The same scene, with intenser variations,
was played about twice a week till the girl
got her way, as she always did in the end,
except in the matter of cheap finery. Taste
in dress was as vital to the mother as her
religion. Then, through the influence of an
old governess of her mother&rsquo;s, Maisie got
her wish. She was to go as companion to
an old lady, the mother of Lady Yalding,
and she was to live at Yalding Towers. Here
was splendour&mdash;here would be life, incident,
opportunity! For her reading had sometimes
strayed from <i>Home Hints</i> to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
<i>Family Herald</i>, and she knew exactly what
are the chances of romance to a humble
companion in the family of a lady of title.</p>

<p>And now Maisie&rsquo;s mother gave way to
her, finally and completely, even on the
question of dress. The old wardrobe was
ransacked to find materials to fit her out
with clothes for her new venture. It was a
beautiful time for Maisie. New things, and
old things made to look as good as new, or
better. It was like having a trousseau. The
mother lavished on her child every inch of
the old lace, every one of the treasured
trinkets&mdash;even the little old locket that had
been the dead husband&rsquo;s first love-gift.</p>

<p>And Maisie, in the flutter of her excitement
and anticipation, was loving and tender
and charming, and the mother had her reward.</p>

<p>Edward opposed a stolid and stony disapproval
to all the new enthusiasm. He
said little because he feared to say too much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor little Maisie!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
soon find out that you didn&rsquo;t know when
you were well off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Edward, I hate you,&rdquo; said Maisie, and
she thought she did.</p>

<p>But when all the beautiful new clothes
were packed and her cab was at the door,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
some sense of what she was leaving did come
to the girl, and she flung her arms round
her mother in an embrace such as she had
never given in her life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Mummy
darling, I&rsquo;ve been a little beast about it. I
won&rsquo;t go if you say you&rsquo;d rather not. Shall
I send the cab away? I will if you say so,
my own dear old Mummy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maisie&rsquo;s mother was not a very wise woman,
but she was not fool enough to trust this
new softness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, dearest,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;go and try
your own way. God bless you, my darling!
You&rsquo;ll miss the train if you stay. God bless
you, my darling!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Maisie went away crying hard through
the new veil with the black velvet spots on
it; as for the mother&mdash;but she was elderly,
and plain, and foolishly fond, and her emotions
can have but little interest for the readers
of romances.</p>

<p>And now Maisie, for the first time, knew
the meaning of home. And before she had
been at Yalding a week she had learned to
analyse home and to give names to its constituents:
love, interest, sympathy, liberty&mdash;these
were some.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
At Yalding Towers Maisie was nothing to
any one. No one knew or cared one single
little bit of a straw whether she was unhappy
or no. Her time was filled, and overfilled,
by the attentions exacted by an old, eccentric,
and very disagreeable lady. When she put
on, for the first evening, the least pretty of
the pretty dresses she had brought with her,
the old lady looked at her with a disapproval
almost rising to repulsion, and said: &ldquo;I
expect you to wear black; and a linen
collar and cuffs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So another black dress had to be ordered
from home, and all the pretty, dainty things
lay creasing themselves with disuse in the
ample drawers and cupboards of her vast,
dreary bedroom.</p>

<p>Her employer was exacting and irritable.
When on the third day Maisie broke into
tears under the constant flood of nagging,
the old lady told her to go away and not to
come back till she could control her temper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come back when you send for me,
and not before, you hateful old thing!&rdquo; said
Maisie to herself.</p>

<p>And she sat down in her fireless bedroom
and wrote a long letter to her mother, saying
how happy she felt, and how kind every one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
was, and what a lovely and altogether desirable
place was Yalding Towers. Who shall say
whether pride or love, or both, dictated that
letter?</p>

<p>When her employer did send for her, it
was to tell her, very sharply, that one more
such exhibition of sullenness would cost her
her situation. So she had to learn to school
herself. And she did it. But the learning
was hard, very hard, and in the learning she
grew thinner, and some of the pretty pink
in her cheeks faded away.</p>

<p>Lady Yalding, when she swept in, in
beautiful dream-dresses, always spoke to the
companion quite kindly and nicely and
pleasantly, but there were none of those
invitations to come into the drawing-room
after dinner which the <i>Family Herald</i> had
led her to expect. Lady Yalding was always
charming to every one, and Maisie tortured
herself with the thought that it was only
because she had no opportunity to explain
herself that Lady Yalding failed to see how
very much out of the common she was. She
read Ruskin industriously, and once she left
her own book of Browning selections that
Edward had given her in the conservatory.
She imagined Lady Yalding returning it to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
her with, &ldquo;So, are you fond of poetry?&rdquo; or,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s delightful to find that you are a lover
of Browning!&rdquo; But the book was brought
back to her by a footman, and the old lady
lectured her for leaving her rubbish littering
about.</p>

<p>But towards Christmas a change came.
Maisie had hoped&mdash;more intensely than she
had ever in her life hoped for anything&mdash;for
a few days&rsquo; grace, for a sight of her
mother, and the mahogany, and the damask
curtains, and&mdash;yes&mdash;of Edward. But the
old lady, who really was exceptionally horrid,
wondered how she could ask for a holiday
when she had only been in her situation six
weeks.</p>

<p>Then the old lady went off at half an
hour&rsquo;s notice to spend Christmas with her
other daughter&mdash;Maisie would have suspected
a &ldquo;row&rdquo; if Lady Yalding had been a shade
less charming&mdash;and the girl was left. Thus
it happened that Lord Yalding&rsquo;s brother
lounged into Lady Yalding&rsquo;s room one day,
and said: &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the piteous black mouse
you&rsquo;ve tamed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Jim?&rdquo; said Lady
Yalding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The crushed apple-blossom in a black
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
frock&mdash;one meets her about the corridors.
Gloomy sight. Chestnut hair. Princess-in-exile
sort of look.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>that</i>! It&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s companion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor little devil!&rdquo; said the Honourable
James. &ldquo;What does she do now the cat&rsquo;s
away? I beg your pardon&mdash;my mind was
running on mice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do? I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Lady Yalding
a little guiltily. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a good, quiet little
thing&mdash;literary tastes, reads Browning, and
all that sort of rot. She&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you give her a show? She&rsquo;d
take the shine out of some of the girls here
if you had her dressed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Jim,&rdquo; Lady Yalding said, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s
all right as she is. What&rsquo;s the good of
turning the child&rsquo;s head and giving her notions
out of her proper station?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I were that child I&rsquo;d like to have a
little bit of a fling just for once. The poor
little rat looks starved, as though it hadn&rsquo;t
laughed for a year. Then it&rsquo;s Christmas&mdash;peace
and goodwill, and all that, don&rsquo;t you
know. If I were you I&rsquo;d ask her down a
bit&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Yalding thought&mdash;a thing she rarely
did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it <i>is</i> pretty slow for
her, I suppose. I&rsquo;ll send her home to her
people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On Christmas Eve? Fog and frost, and
the trains all anyhow? Fanny, Fanny!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well. We&rsquo;ll have her down,
and go the whole hog. Only don&rsquo;t make a
fool of the child, Jim; she&rsquo;s a good little
thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And that was how the dream-dressed Lady
Yalding came to sweep into the old lady&rsquo;s
sitting-room&mdash;it was as full of mahogany, by
the way, as Maisie&rsquo;s home in Lewisham&mdash;and
spoke so kindly of Maisie&rsquo;s loneliness, that the
girl could have fallen down and worshipped
at her Paris shoes.</p>

<p>When Maisie, in the figured lavender satin
that had been her mother&rsquo;s, swept across the
great hall on the arm of the Honourable
James, she felt that this indeed was life.
Here was the great world with its infinite
possibilities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you get on?&rdquo; his sister-in-law
asked him later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s quite a decent sort of little
mouse,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Wants to make sure
you see how cultivated it is, quotes poetry&mdash;what?&mdash;and
talks about art. It&rsquo;s a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
touching and all that to see how busy it
is putting all its poor little stock in the
tiny shop-window.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maisie, alone in her room, was walking
up and down, trailing the lavender satin,
recalling with kindled eyes and red-rose
cheeks every word, every look of her cavalier.
How kindly he had spoken, yet how
deferentially; how he had looked, how he
had smiled! At dinner she supposed it was
his business to talk to her. But afterwards,
when she was sitting, a little forlornly and
apart from the noisy chatter of the bright-plumaged
house-party, how he had come
straight over to her directly the gentlemen
came into the drawing-room! And she felt
that she had not been wanting to herself on
so great an occasion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <i>know</i> I talked well. I&rsquo;m certain he
saw directly that I wasn&rsquo;t a silly idiot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She lay long awake, and, as the men
trooped up the stairs, she tried to fancy that
she could already distinguish his footsteps.</p>

<p>The letter she wrote to her mother next
day was, compared to those other lying
letters, as a lit chandelier to a stable-lantern.
And the mother knew the difference.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor darling!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;She must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
have been very miserable all this time. But
she&rsquo;s happy now, God bless her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the week&rsquo;s end, every thought, every
dream, every hope of Maisie&rsquo;s life was
centred in the Honourable James; her
tenderness, her ambition turned towards him
as flowers to the sun.</p>

<p>And her happiness lighted a thousand
little candles all around her. No one could
see the candles, of course, but every one
saw the radiant illumination of her beauty.
And the other men of the house-party saw
it too. Even Lord Yalding distinguished
her by asking whether she had read some
horrid book about earthworms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re making a fool of that girl, Jim,&rdquo;
said Lady Yalding. &ldquo;I really think it&rsquo;s too
bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My good Fanny, don&rsquo;t be an adorable
idiot! I&rsquo;m only trying to give the poor
little duffer a good time. There&rsquo;s nothing
else to do. The other girls really are&mdash;now,
you know they are, Fanny&mdash;between
ourselves&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all duty people, of course,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Well, only do be careful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was careful. He subdued his impulses
to tenderness and gentle raillery. He talked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
seriously to little Miss Mouse, and presently
he found that she was seriously talking to
him&mdash;telling him, for instance, how she
wrote poetry, and how she longed to show
it to some one and ask whether it really was
so bad as she sometimes feared.</p>

<p>What could he do but beg her to show
it to him? But there he pulled himself up
short.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s skating to-morrow. We&rsquo;re going
to drive over to Dansent. Would you
like to come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her grey eyes looked up quickly, and
the long lashes drooped over them. She
had read of that trick in a book, and for
the life of him he could not help knowing
it. Her answer to his question came from
a book, too, though it also came from her
heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you know!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Honourable James was honestly
frightened. Next day he had a telegram,
and departed abruptly. And as abruptly
the old lady returned.</p>

<p>And now Maisie had a secret joy to feed
on&mdash;a manna to sustain her in the wilderness
of her tiresome life. She thought of
<i>him</i>. He loved her; she was certain of it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
Miss Mouse could imagine no reason but
love for the kindness he had shown her.
He had gone away without a word, but
that was for some good reason. Probably he
had gone to confess to his mother how he
had given his whole heart to a penniless
orphan&mdash;well, she was half an orphan, anyway.
But the days slipped by and he did
not come back. All that bright time at
Christmas had faded like a picture from a
magic-lantern when the slide is covered.
Lady Yalding was quite nice and kind, but
she left Maisie to the work Maisie was paid
for.</p>

<p>Maisie&rsquo;s mother perceived, through Maisie&rsquo;s
studied accounts of her happiness, more than
a glimpse of the reality.</p>

<p>Then, at last, when the days grew unbearable,
Maisie wrote to him, a prim little letter
with agitated heart-beats between the lines,
where he, being no fool, did not fail to find
them. Yet he had to answer the letter.
He did it briefly.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Rolleston</span>,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;I
have received your letter and the little poem,
which is very nice. Poems about Spring are
the pleasantest kind, I think.&mdash;With kind
regards, I am yours sincerely.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>It was not, as you may see, worth the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
heartache with which Maisie watched for it.</p>

<p>It was when she wrote again, and sent
more verses, that he decided he must not
mince matters.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Rolleston</span>,&rdquo; was his second
letter, &ldquo;it is good of you to write again.
Now I do hope you won&rsquo;t be offended with
me for what I am going to say. I am so much
older than you, you know, and I know you
are alone at Yalding, with no one to advise
you, so it must be my duty to do it, though, for
my own sake, I should, of course, like to advise
you quite differently. It was a great pleasure
to me to hear from you, but I must not allow
myself that pleasure again, even if you were
willing to give it to me. It would not be fair
to you to let you write any more to a man
who is not related to you. Try to forgive
me for being unselfish and acting in your
interests and not my own.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>And again, with kind regards, he was hers
sincerely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor, pretty little duffer!&rdquo; he said, as he
closed the envelope. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not real.
Don&rsquo;t I know the sort of thing? She&rsquo;s
simply bored to death down there. And
it&rsquo;s all my fault, anyhow. By Jove! I&rsquo;ll
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
never try to do any one a good turn again
as long as I live. Fanny was perfectly right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The letter came by the second post, when
Maisie was engaged in drearily reading her
employer to sleep after lunch.</p>

<p>It lay on her lap, but she kept her eyes
from it and read on intelligibly if not with
expression.</p>

<p>The old lady dozed.</p>

<p>Maisie opened her letter. And before she
could even have had time to put up a hand
to save herself, her Spanish castle was
tumbling about her ears. A curious giddy
feeling seemed to catch at the back of her
neck, the room gave a sickening half-turn.
She caught at her self-control.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not here. I mustn&rsquo;t faint here. Not
with his letter in my hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She got out of the room somehow, and
somehow she got into hat and jacket and
boots, put her quarter&rsquo;s salary in her purse,
and walked out of the front door and straight
down the great drive that she had come up
four months ago with such bright hopes. She
went to the station, and she took a train,
and she never stopped nor stayed till she
was at home again. She pushed past the
frightened maid, and, pale and shabby, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
black-ringed eyes and dusty black gown, she
burst into her mother&rsquo;s room. The scent of
eau-de-Cologne and bees&rsquo;-wax and buttered
toast met her, and it was as the perfume of
Paradise. Edward was there&mdash;but she was in
no mood to bother about Edward. She threw
herself on her knees and buried her face in
the knitting on her mother&rsquo;s lap, and felt
thin arms go round her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing. I&rsquo;m tired of it all. I&rsquo;ve
come home,&rdquo; was all she said. But presently
she reached out a hand to Edward, and he
took it and held it, as it were, absently, and
the three sat by the fire and spoke little and
were content.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>To her dying day Maisie will never forget
the sense of peace, of enfolding care, and love
unchanging and unchangeable that came to
her as she woke next morning to find her
mother standing by her bed with a cup of
tea in her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mummy darling,&rdquo; she cried, throwing
her arms round her mother and nearly upsetting
the tea, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had a single drop of
in-bed tea all the time I&rsquo;ve been away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was all she found words to tell her
mother. Later there was Edward, and she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
told him most things, but, I imagine, not all.
But the mother was content without spoken
confidences. She knew that Maisie had
suffered, and that now she had her little
girl again, to wrap warm in her love as
before. This was happiness enough.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>This story, I know, is instructive enough
for a Sunday School prize. It ought to be
tagged at the end with a Moral. I can&rsquo;t
help it: it is true. Of course, it is not
what usually happens. Many companions, no
doubt, marry Honourable James&rsquo;s, or even
Dukes, and are never at all glad to get home
to their mothers and their Edwards. But
Maisie was different. She feels now a sort
of grateful tenderness for Yalding Towers,
because, but for the dream she dreamed
there she might never have really awakened&mdash;never
have known fully and without
mistake what it was in life that she truly
cared for. And such knowledge is half the
secret of happiness. That, by the way, is
really the moral of this story.</p>

<h2 class="padtop smlpadb">IX<br />
<br />
THE OLD WIFE</h2>


<p>&ldquo;Yes; married by the 30th of June, introduce
my wife to the tenants on Christmas
Eve, or no fortune. That was my uncle&rsquo;s
last and worst joke; he was reputed a funny
man in his time. The alternatives are pretty
ghastly either way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that rather depend?&rdquo; Sylvia
queried, with a swift blue glance from under
veiling lashes.</p>

<p>Michael answered her with a look, the
male counterpart of her own, from dark
Devon eyes, the upper lid arched in a perfect
semicircle over pure grey. &ldquo;Yes; but my
wife must have a hundred a year of her
own in Consols, to protect me from fortune-hunters&mdash;lone,
lorn lamb that I am!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sylvia emphasised the sigh with which she
admitted her indigence. Her pretty eyebrows
owned plaintively that she, a struggling artist,
had no claim against the nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
&ldquo;Mary has just a hundred a year,&rdquo; she
said, her voice low-toned as she looked across
the room to where, demure in braided locks
and grey camlet, her companion sat knitting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I daresay,&rdquo; Michael answered indifferently,
following her eyes&rsquo; flight and her tone&rsquo;s low
pitch; &ldquo;but she&rsquo;s young. I shall advertise for
an elderly housekeeper. And <i>qui vivra verra</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words, lightly cast on the thin soil of
a foolish word-play with a pretty woman,
bore fruit.</p>

<p>A week later Michael Wood stood aghast
before a tray heaped with letters, answers to
his advertisement:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Housekeeper wanted. Must be middle-aged.
The older the better. Salary, £500 a
year.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Not much, he had thought, £500 a year&mdash;if,
by paying it, he might win a wife who
would entitle him to an annual £15,000,
whose declining years he might kindly cheer,
and whose death would set him free to marry
a wife whom he could love. His fancy drifted
pleasantly towards Sylvia.</p>

<p>Michael was a lazy man, who bristled
with business instincts. He telephoned to
the nearest &ldquo;typewriters&rsquo; association&rdquo; for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
secretary, and to this young woman he committed
the charge of answering the letters
which his advertisement had drawn forth.
The answer was to be the same to all:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Call at 17 Hare Court, Temple, between
11 and 1.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>And the dates fixed for such calling were
arranged to allow about fifty interviews daily
for the next week or two, for Michael was
a bold man as well as a lazy one. The next
morning, faultlessly dressed, with carnations in
his buttonhole, he composed himself in his
pleasant oak-furnished room to await his first
batch of callers.</p>

<p>They came. And Michael, strong in his
unswerving determination not to forfeit his
chance of inheriting the £15,000 a year left
him under his mad uncle&rsquo;s mad will, saw
them all, one after the other.</p>

<p>But he did not like any of them. They
were old; that he did not mind&mdash;it was,
indeed, of the essence of the contract. But
they were frowsy, too, with reticules of
scarred brownish leather, and mangy fur
trimmings, worn fringes, and beaded mantles,
whence time and poverty had clawed handfuls
of the bright beads. Each of them was,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
as a wife, even as a wife in name, impossible.
The task of rejection was softened to his
hand by the fact that not one of them could
boast the necessary hundred a year in Consols.</p>

<p>The interviews over, Michael, his spirit
crushed by the spectacle of so many women
anxious to find a refuge at an age when
their children and grandchildren should, in
their own homes, have been rising up to call
them blessed, went to lounge a restorative hour
in Sylvia&rsquo;s bright little studio, and laugh
with her over his dilemma. He would have
liked to sigh with her, too, but the pathos
of the homeless old women escaped her. She
saw only the humour of the situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no harm done, if it amuses you,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ll never marry an old
woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fifteen thousand pounds a year,&rdquo; said
Michael softly.</p>

<p>Next day more poor old ladies, all eager,
anxious, ineligible.</p>

<p>It was on the third day that the old lady
in dove-colour came in, sweet as a pressed
flower in an old love-letter, dainty as a pigeon
in spring. Her white hair, the white lace
of her collar, the black lace of her mantle,
her beautiful little hands in their perfect,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
dove-coloured gloves, all appealed irresistibly
to Michael&rsquo;s æsthetic sense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What an ideal housekeeper!&rdquo; he said to
himself, as he placed a chair for her. And
then an odd thrill of discomfort and shame
shot through him. This delicate, dainty old
lady&mdash;he was to insult her by a form of
marriage, and then to live near her, waiting
for her death? No; it was impossible&mdash;the
whole thing was impossible. He found himself
in the middle of a sentence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so I fear I am already suited.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old lady raised eyebrows as delicate
as Sylvia&rsquo;s own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hardly, I think,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;since your
servant admitted me to an interview with
you. May I ask you one or two questions
before you finally decide against me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The voice was low and soft&mdash;the voice men
loved in the early sixties, before the shrill
shriek became the voice of fashionable ladies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; Michael said. He could hardly
say less, and in the tumult of embarrassment
that had swept over him, he could not for
his life have said more.</p>

<p>The old lady went on. &ldquo;I am competent
to manage a house. I can read aloud fairly
well. I am a good nurse in case of sickness;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
and I am accustomed to entertain. But I
gather from the amount of the salary offered
that some other duties would be required of
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s clever of her, too,&rdquo; Michael
thought; &ldquo;none of the others saw that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He bowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you enlighten me,&rdquo; she went on,
&ldquo;as to the nature of the services you would
require?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;yes&mdash;of course,&rdquo; he said glibly, and
then stopped short.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From your hesitation,&rdquo; said the old lady,
with unimpaired self-possession, &ldquo;I gather that
the matter involves an explanation of some
delicacy, or else&mdash;pardon the egotism&mdash;that
my appearance is personally unpleasing to
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;oh, <i>no</i>,&rdquo; Michael said very eagerly;
&ldquo;on the contrary, if I may say so, it is just
because you are so&mdash;so&mdash;exactly my ideal of
an old lady, that I feel I can&rsquo;t go on with
the business; and that&rsquo;s put stupidly, so
that it sounds like an insult. Please forgive
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked him straight in the eyes through
her gold-rimmed spectacles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, I am old enough to be your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
grandmother,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why not tell me
the truth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, to his horror and astonishment, he
told it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what I meant to do,&rdquo; he ended.
&ldquo;It was a mad idea, and I see now that if I
do it at all I must marry some one who is
not&mdash;who is not like you. You have made
me ashamed of myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A spot of pink colour glowed in her faded
cheek. The old lady put up her gloved hand
and touched her cheek, as if it burned. She
got up and walked to the window, and stood
there, looking out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you <i>are</i> going to do it,&rdquo; she said in a
voice that was hardly audible, &ldquo;I have been
used to live among beautiful surroundings&mdash;I
should like to end my days among them.
I do not come of a long-lived family. You
would not have long to wait for your freedom
and your second wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Never in all his days had Michael known
so sharp an agony of embarrassment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When must you be married,&rdquo; the old lady
went on calmly, &ldquo;to ensure your fortunes
and estates?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In about a month.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr Wood, I make you a formal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
offer of marriage, and for reference I can give
you my banker and my solicitor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice was calm; it was his voice that
trembled as he answered: &ldquo;You are too good.
I can&rsquo;t see that it would be fair to you.
May I think about it till to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The contrast between the old lady&rsquo;s dainty
correctness of attire and speech, and the
extraordinary unconventionality of her proposal,
made Michael&rsquo;s brain reel. She
turned from the window, again looked him
fairly in the eyes, and said: &ldquo;You will
not find me unconventional in other matters.
This is purely an affair of business, and I
approach it in a business spirit. You would
be giving a home to one who wants it, and
I should be helping you to what you need
still more. I have never been married. I
never wished to marry; and when I am
dead&mdash;&mdash; Don&rsquo;t look so horror-stricken. I
should not die any sooner because you&mdash;you
had married me. My name is Thrale&mdash;Frances
Thrale. That is my card that you
have been pulling to pieces while you have
been talking to me. Shall I come and see
you again at this time to-morrow? It is
not a subject on which I should wish
either to write or to receive letters.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
He could only acquiesce. At the door
the old lady turned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you think I look so old as to make
your marriage too absurd,&rdquo; she said&mdash;and
now, for the first time, her voice trembled&mdash;&ldquo;I
could dye my hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; Michael said, &ldquo;your hair is
beautiful. Good-bye, and thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the old lady went down the dusty
Temple stairs she stamped a small foot
angrily on the worn oak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how could you?
Hateful, shameless, unwomanly! And it&rsquo;s
all for nothing, too. He&rsquo;ll never do it.
It&rsquo;s <i>too</i> mad!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Michael went straight to Sylvia, and told
his tale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I felt I couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;she
is the daintiest, sweetest little old lady. I
couldn&rsquo;t marry her and see her every day
and live in the hope of her death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why not,&rdquo; Sylvia said, a
little coldly. &ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t die any sooner
because you married her, and, anyway, she
can&rsquo;t have long to live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words were almost those of the little
old lady herself. Yet&mdash;or perhaps for that
very reason&mdash;they jarred on Michael&rsquo;s mood.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
He alleged business, and cut short his
call.</p>

<p>Next day Miss Thrale called again. Mr
Wood was sorry to have given her so much
trouble. He had decided that the idea
was too wild, and must be abandoned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it because I am too old?&rdquo; said the
old lady wistfully; &ldquo;would you marry me
if I were young?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, I believe I would,&rdquo;
Michael surprised himself by saying. That
it was not the answer Miss Thrale expected
was evident from her smile of sudden
amusement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I say,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;in return for
what, in its way, is a compliment, that I
like you very much. I would take care of
you, and I shall perhaps not live more than
a year or two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tremor of her voice touched him.
The £15,000 a year pulled at his will. In
that instant he saw the broad glades of
waving bracken, the big trees of the park,
the sober face of the great house he might
inherit, looking out over the smooth green
lawns. He looked again at the little lady.
After all, he was more than thirty. The
world would laugh&mdash;well, they laughed best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
who laughed last. And, after a few years,
there would be Sylvia&mdash;pretty, charming,
enchanting Sylvia. He put the thought of
her roughly away. Not because he was
ashamed of it, but because it hurt him.
The thought that Sylvia should wait for a
dead woman&rsquo;s shoes had seemed natural;
what hurt him was that she herself should
see nothing unnatural in such waiting.</p>

<p>The silence had grown to the limit that
spells discomfort; the ticking of the tall
clock, the rustle of the plane tree&rsquo;s leaves
outside the window, the discords of Fleet
Street harmonised by distance, all deepened
the silence and italicised it. She spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>The plane tree&rsquo;s leaves murmured eloquently
of the great oaks in the park. The old lady&rsquo;s
eyes looked at him appealingly through the
pale-smoked glasses. How she would like
that old place! And his debts&mdash;he could
pay them all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; he said suddenly; &ldquo;if you will,
I will; and I pray you may never regret it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think <i>you</i> will regret it,&rdquo; she
said gently; &ldquo;it is a truly kind act to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bank and solicitor, duly consulted, testified
to Miss Thrale&rsquo;s respectability and to her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
income&mdash;the requisite hundred a year in
Consols. And on a certain day in June
Michael Wood woke from a feverish dream,
in which obstinacy and the longing for
money had fought with many better things
and worsted them, to find himself married
to a white-haired woman of sixty.</p>

<p>The awakening took place in his rooms in
the Temple. He had yielded to the little
old lady&rsquo;s entreaties, and consented, most
willingly, to forego the &ldquo;wedding journey,&rdquo;
in this case so sad a mockery.</p>

<p>The set was a large one&mdash;five rooms; it
seemed that they might live here, and
neither irk the other.</p>

<p>And she was in the room he had caused
to be prepared for her&mdash;dainty and neat as
herself&mdash;and he, left alone in the room where
he had first seen her, crossed his arms on the
table, and thought. His wedding-day! And
it might have been Sylvia, the rustle of whose
dress he could hear in the next room. He
groaned. Then he laid his head on his arms
and cried&mdash;like a child that has lost its
favourite toy: for he saw, suddenly, that
respect for his old wife must keep him from
ever seeing Sylvia now; and life looked grey
as the Thames in February twilight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
A timid hand on his shoulder startled him
to the raising of his tear-stained face. The
little old lady stood beside him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she said softly&mdash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t!
Believe me, it will be all right. Your old
wife won&rsquo;t live more than a year&mdash;I know
it. Take courage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Don&rsquo;t!</i>&rdquo; he said in his turn; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a
wicked thing I&rsquo;ve done. Forgive me! If
only we could have been friends. I can&rsquo;t
bear to think I shall make you unhappy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we are friends.
I am your housekeeper. In a year at latest
you will see the last of my white hairs. Be
brave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He could not understand the pang her
words gave him.</p>

<p>And now began, for these two, a strange
life. In those Temple rooms&mdash;ideal nest for
young lovers&mdash;Mrs Wood, the white-haired,
kept house with firm and capable little
hands. Comfort, which Michael&rsquo;s lazy nature
loved but could not achieve, reigned peacefully.
The old lady kept much to her own
rooms, but whenever he needed talk she was
there. And she could talk. She had read
much, reflected much. In her mind his own
ideas found mating germs, and bore fruit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
beautiful dreams, great thoughts. His verses&mdash;neglected
this long time, since Sylvia did
not care for poetry&mdash;flourished once more.</p>

<p>And music&mdash;Sylvia&rsquo;s taste in music had
been Sullivan; the old wife touched the piano
with magic fingers, and Bach, Beethoven,
Wagner came to transfigure the Temple
rooms. Michael had never been so contented&mdash;never
so wretched; for, as the quiet weeks
went by, the leaves fell from the plane tree,
and the time drew near when he must show
his wife to the tenants&mdash;his white-haired wife.
In these months a very real friendship had
grown up between them. Michael had never
met a woman, old or young, whose tastes
chimed so tunefully with his own. Ah! what
a pity he had not met a <i>young</i> woman with
these tastes&mdash;this soul. And now, liking,
friendship, affection&mdash;all the finer, nobler side
of love&mdash;he could indeed feel for his old
wife; but love&mdash;lovers&rsquo; love, that would set
the seal on all the rest&mdash;this he might never
know, except for some other woman, who
would succeed to his wife&rsquo;s title.</p>

<p>Badly as Michael had behaved, I think it
is permissible to be sorry for him. His wife,
in fact, was very sorry.</p>

<p>One day he met Sylvia in the park, and all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
the other side of him thrilled with pleasure.
He sat by her an hour, his eyes drinking in
her fresh beauty, while his soul shrivelled
more and more. Ah! why could she not
<i>talk</i>, as his wife could, instead of merely
chattering?</p>

<p>His wife looked sad that evening. He
asked the reason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw you in the park to-day,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Are you going to see her? Don&rsquo;t compromise
her: it&rsquo;s not worth while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He kissed her hand in its black mitten,
and in a flash of pain saw the black funeral,
when she should be carried from his house,
and he be left free to marry Sylvia.</p>

<p>And now the days had dropped past; so
even was their flow that it seemed rapid,
and in another week it would be Christmas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I must show you to the tenants,&rdquo;
said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My poor boy,&rdquo; she said&mdash;it was just as
she had risen to bid him good night&mdash;&ldquo;be
brave. Perhaps it won&rsquo;t be so bad as you
think. Good night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sat still after she had left him, gazing
into the fire, and thinking thoughts in which
now the estate and the fortune played but
little part. At last he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have no lover, no
wife; but I have a companion, a friend&mdash;one
in a million.&rdquo; And again the black funeral
trailed its slow length before his eyes, and
he shuddered.</p>

<p>I have not sought to deceive the reader.
He knows as well as I do that at this moment
the door opened, and a young and beautiful
woman stood on the threshold. Her eyes
were shining; round her neck were gleaming
pearls. She was playing for a high stake,
and being a true woman she had disdained no
honest artifice that might help her. She wore
shining white silk, severely plain, and her
brown hair was dressed high on her head.
A woman one shade less intuitive would
have let the dusky masses fall over a lace-covered
tea-gown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Michael,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am your wife. Are
you going to forgive me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He raised himself slowly from his chair,
and his eyes dwelt on detail after detail of
the beauty before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My wife!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are a
stranger!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <i>did</i> disguise myself well. My sister
told me about your advertisement; she
lives with Sylvia Maddox. We each have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
a hundred pounds a year. At first I did
it for fun; but when I had seen how&mdash;how
nice you were&mdash;my mother is very poor.
There are no excuses. But are you going
to forgive me?&rdquo; Any other woman, to
whom forgiveness meant all that it meant
to her, might have kneeled at his feet.
Frances stood erect by the door. &ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo;
she said, biting her lip, &ldquo;I have saved
you from Sylvia. For the sake of that,
forgive me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That stung him, as she had known it
would.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Never. You&rsquo;ve
spoiled my life.&rdquo; But he took a step towards
her as he spoke.</p>

<p>She took an equal step back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take courage,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Who knows
but I may die before next June, after all.
Good night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hate you,&rdquo; he said, and took another
step forward. But the door closed in his
face.</p>

<p>Next morning the old lady, white haired and
mittened, appeared behind the breakfast tea.
Michael almost thought he had dreamed, till
her eyes, now without their glasses, met his
timidly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
&ldquo;Let us end this play-acting, at least,&rdquo; he
said. Ten minutes of fuming ended in tepid
tea poured by a beautiful brown-haired girl.</p>

<p>He watched her in silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s horrible,&rdquo; he broke out. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a
strange woman, and there you sit, pouring
tea out as if&mdash;&mdash; Who are you? I don&rsquo;t
know you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she said quietly. And then
he remembered all the old talks with the old
wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to be a brute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use my saying I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Are</i> you?&rdquo; He leaned forward to put the
question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must make the best of it,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;&mdash; Look here, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s speak
of it till after Christmas; let&rsquo;s just go on
as we did before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the days wore on. But the situation
when Michael lived in torment in the company
of his old wife was simplicity itself compared
to his new life with a wife&mdash;young, beautiful,
and a stranger, yet in all essentials his dearest
friend. This discomfort grew daily&mdash;hourly
branching out into ever fresh embarrassments&mdash;new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
and harassing, vexatious, half understood,
wholly resented.</p>

<p>The wife had her burden to bear also. The
laundress had only known the old wife as
&ldquo;Mrs Wood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She thought I was your mother,&rdquo; the wife
said when Michael propounded the difficulty.
But the laundress&rsquo;s attitude to the new Mrs
Wood had a sting that was almost punishment
enough to the wife, had Michael only
known, for all that she had done amiss.</p>

<p>The hour of departure for the Christmas
festivities at Wood Grange came as a relief
from the persistent pinpricks of unexplained
emotion which tormented him. His wife was
young and beautiful, yet he was only conscious
of repulsion. He hated her for her trickery.
But most he hated her because she had cheated
him of the old wife&mdash;the friend, the <i>confidante</i>,
who had grown to be so much, and so much
the best part, in his life. For now there was
no confidence between the two&mdash;no talk, no
reading, no music to brighten the Temple
rooms. They lived in an almost complete
silence.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Every window of the Grange shone out
with yellow light across the snow. For once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
Christmas had been kind and seasonable&mdash;a
white sheet covered the world. Holly
gleamed against old oak. Priceless silver,
saved from the smelting-pot in Cromwell&rsquo;s
hard days, shone above white napery on the
long tables. The tenants&rsquo; dinner was over,
and now was the moment when, according
to the will, Michael Wood&rsquo;s wife must be
presented to the tenants then assembled.</p>

<p>The slender figure in white woollen cloth
and white fur, with Christmas roses at its
breast, stood on the daïs at the end of the
great hall, and the tenants cheered themselves
hoarse at the mere sight of her beautiful face,
her kind eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It went off very well,&rdquo; Michael said when,
the last guest gone, the last shutter closed,
the last servant departed, the two stood alone
in the long drawing-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; think if you had had to present to
them the old white-haired wife&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I loved the old wife,&rdquo; he said obstinately;
but his voice was not quite steady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; she said, playing with the
Christmas roses she wore, &ldquo;I wish you
would try to forgive me. It was horribly
wrong; but I began it as a joke. You see,
I had only just come over from the convent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
where I was brought up. I thought it would
be such fun: I was always good at theatricals.
I will never do anything silly again. And
to-morrow I&rsquo;ll go away, and you need never
see me again. And you <i>have</i> got the money
and the old place, haven&rsquo;t you? And I got
them for you&mdash;and&mdash;do forgive me. It began
as a silly schoolgirl&rsquo;s joke indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;a convent! You have read and
thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was my father. He made me read
and think; and when he died all the money
went, and my mother is poor. Oh, Michael,
don&rsquo;t be so flinty! Say you forgive me
before I go! It all began in a joke!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Began. Yes. But why did you go on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t like Sylvia&mdash;and I
liked you&mdash;rather&mdash;but I won&rsquo;t be a nuisance.
I&rsquo;ll go back to mother. Say you forgive me.
I&rsquo;ll go by the first train in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first train,&rdquo; said Michael absently,
&ldquo;is the 9.17; but to-morrow is Christmas
Day&mdash;I daresay they&rsquo;ll run the same as on
Sunday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She took her white cloak from the settle
by the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; she said sadly; &ldquo;you are
very hard. Won&rsquo;t you even shake hands?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
&ldquo;We had no roses at our wedding,&rdquo; he
said, still absently; &ldquo;but there are roses at
Christmas.&rdquo; He raised his hand to the
white flowers she wore, and touched them
softly. &ldquo;White roses, too, for a wedding,&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good night!&rdquo; she said again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you will go to your mother to-morrow
by the 9.17 train, or the 10.5, if the trains run
the same as on Sunday. And I am to forgive
you, and shake hands before we part. Well,
well!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took the hand she held out, caught
the other, and stood holding them, his grey
eyes seeking hers. Her head thrown back,
her hands stretched out, she looked at him
from arm&rsquo;s length.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear!&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>A mute glance questioned him. Then lashes
longer than Sylvia&rsquo;s veiled the dark eyes.</p>

<p>He spoke again. &ldquo;Dear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know you hate me,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>He raised her hands to his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you forgotten Sylvia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Absolutely, thank God! And you&mdash;I&mdash;after
all, we are married, though there were
no roses at our June wedding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again her eyes questioned mutely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
He leaned forward and touched the
Christmas roses with his lips. Then he
dropped her hands and caught her by the
shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! foolish, foolish, foolish people!&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;We two are man and wife. My
wife! my wife! my wife! We are, aren&rsquo;t
we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose we are,&rdquo; she said, and her face
leaned a little towards his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then!&rdquo; said he.</p>

<br />
THE HOUSE OF SILENCE</h2>


<p>The thief stood close under the high wall,
and looked to right and left. To the right
the road wound white and sinuous, lying
like a twisted ribbon over the broad grey
shoulder of the hill; to the left the road
turned sharply down towards the river;
beyond the ford the road went away slowly
in a curve, prolonged for miles through the
green marshes.</p>

<p>No least black fly of a figure stirred on
it. There were no travellers at such an hour
on such a road.</p>

<p>The thief looked across the valley, at the
top of the mountain flushed with sunset, and
at the grey-green of the olives about its
base. The terraces of olives were already
dusk with twilight, but his keen eyes could
not have missed the smallest variance or
shifting of their lights and shadows. Nothing
stirred there. He was alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
Then, turning, he looked again at the wall
behind him. The face of it was grey and
sombre, but all along the top of it, in the
crannies of the coping stones, orange wallflowers
and sulphur-coloured snapdragons
shone among the haze of feathery-flowered
grasses. He looked again at the place where
some of the stones had fallen from the coping&mdash;had
fallen within the wall, for none lay
in the road without. The bough of a mighty
tree covered the gap with its green mantle
from the eyes of any chance wayfarer; but
the thief was no chance wayfarer, and he
had surprised the only infidelity of the great
wall to its trust.</p>

<p>To the chance wayfarer, too, the wall&rsquo;s
denial had seemed absolute, unanswerable.
Its solid stone, close knit by mortar hardly
less solid, showed not only a defence, it
offered a defiance&mdash;a menace. But the thief
had learnt his trade; he saw that the mortar
might be loosened a little here, broken a
little there, and now the crumbs of it fell
rustling on to the dry, dusty grass of the
roadside. He drew back, took two quick
steps forward, and, with a spring, sudden
and agile as a cat&rsquo;s, grasped the wall where
the gap showed, and drew himself up. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
he rubbed his hands on his knees, because
his hands were bloody from the sudden
grasping of the rough stones, and sat astride
on the wall.</p>

<p>He parted the leafy boughs and looked
down; below him lay the stones that had
fallen from the wall&mdash;already grass was growing
upon the mound they made. As he
ventured his head beyond the green leafage,
the level light of the sinking sun struck him
in the eyes. It was like a blow. He dropped
softly from the wall and stood in the shadow
of the tree&mdash;looking, listening.</p>

<p>Before him stretched the park&mdash;wide and
still; dotted here and there with trees, and
overlaid with gold poured from the west.
He held his breath and listened. There was
no wind to stir the leaves to those rustlings
which may deceive and disconcert the keenest
and the boldest; only the sleepy twitter of
birds, and the little sudden soft movements
of them in the dusky privacy of the thick-leaved
branches. There was in all the broad
park no sign of any other living thing.</p>

<p>The thief trod softly along under the wall
where the trees were thickest, and at every
step he paused to look and listen.</p>

<p>It was quite suddenly that he came upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
the little lodge near the great gates of
wrought iron with the marble gate-posts
bearing upon them the two gaunt griffins,
the cognisance of the noble house whose
lands these were. The thief drew back into
the shadow and stood still, only his heart
beat thickly. He stood still as the tree
trunk beside him, looking, listening. He
told himself that he heard nothing&mdash;saw
nothing&mdash;yet he became aware of things.
That the door of the lodge was not closed,
that some of its windows were broken, and
that into its little garden straw and litter
had drifted from the open door: and that
between the stone step and the threshold
grass was growing inches high. When he
was aware of this he stepped forward and
entered the lodge. All the sordid sadness of
a little deserted home met him here&mdash;broken
crocks and bent pans, straw, old rags, and a
brooding, dusty stillness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There has been no one here since the
old keeper died. They told the truth,&rdquo; said
the thief; and he made haste to leave the
lodge, for there was nothing in it now that
any man need covet&mdash;only desolation and
the memory of death.</p>

<p>So he went slowly among the trees, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
by devious ways drew a little nearer to the
great house that stood in its walled garden
in the middle of the park. From very far
off, above the green wave of trees that broke
round it, he could see the towers of it rising
black against the sunset; and between the
trees came glimpses of its marble white
where the faint grey light touched it from
the east.</p>

<p>Moving slowly&mdash;vigilant, alert, with eyes
turning always to right and to left, with ears
which felt the intense silence more acutely
than they could have felt any tumult&mdash;the
thief reached the low wall of the garden, at the
western side. The last redness of the sunset&rsquo;s
reflection had lighted all the many windows,
and the vast place blazed at him for an instant
before the light dipped behind the black bar
of the trees, and left him face to face with a
pale house, whose windows now were black
and hollow, and seemed like eyes that watched
him. Every window was closed; the lower
ones were guarded by jalousies; through the
glass of the ones above he could see the set
painted faces of the shutters.</p>

<p>From far off he had heard, and known,
the plash-plash of fountains, and now he saw
their white changing columns rise and fall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
against the background of the terrace. The
garden was full of rose bushes trailing and
unpruned; and the heavy, happy scent of
the roses, still warm from the sun, breathed
through the place, exaggerating the sadness
of its tangled desolation. Strange figures
gleamed in the deepening dusk, but they
were too white to be feared. He crept into
a corner where Psyche drooped in marble,
and, behind her pedestal, crouched. He took
food from his pockets and ate and drank.
And between the mouthfuls he listened and
watched.</p>

<p>The moon rose, and struck a pale fire from
the face of the house and from the marble
limbs of the statues, and the gleaming water
of the fountains drew the moonbeams into
the unchanging change of its rise and fall.</p>

<p>Something rustled and stirred among the
roses. The thief grew rigid: his heart
seemed suddenly hollow; he held his breath.
Through the deepening shadows something
gleamed white; and not marble, for it moved,
it came towards him. Then the silence of
the night was shattered by a scream, as the
white shape glided into the moonlight. The
thief resumed his munching, and another
shape glimmered after the first. &ldquo;Curse the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
beasts!&rdquo; he said, and took another draught
from his bottle, as the white peacocks were
blotted out by the shadows of the trees,
and the stillness of the night grew more
intense.</p>

<p>In the moonlight the thief went round
and about the house, pushing through the
trailing briers that clung to him&mdash;and now
grown bolder he looked closely at doors and
windows. But all were fast barred as the
doors of a tomb. And the silence deepened
as the moonlight waxed.</p>

<p>There was one little window, high up,
that showed no shutter. He looked at it;
measured its distance from the ground and
from the nearest of the great chestnut trees.
Then he walked along under the avenue of
chestnuts with head thrown back and eyes
fixed on the mystery of their interlacing
branches.</p>

<p>At the fifth tree he stopped; leaped to the
lowest bough, missed it; leaped again, caught
it, and drew up his body. Then climbing,
creeping, swinging, while the leaves, agitated
by his progress, rustled to the bending of
the boughs, he passed to that tree, to the
next&mdash;swift, assured, unhesitating. And so
from tree to tree, till he was at the last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
tree&mdash;and on the bough that stretched to
touch the little window with its leaves.</p>

<p>He swung from this. The bough bent
and cracked, and would have broken, but
that at the only possible instant the thief
swung forward, felt the edge of the window
with his feet, loosed the bough, sprang, and
stood, flattened against the mouldings, clutching
the carved drip-stone with his hands.
He thrust his knee through the window,
waiting for the tinkle of the falling glass to
settle into quietness, opened the window, and
crept in. He found himself in a corridor:
he could see the long line of its white
windows, and the bars of moonlight falling
across the inlaid wood of its floor.</p>

<p>He took out his thief&rsquo;s lantern&mdash;high and
slender like a tall cup&mdash;lighted it, and crept
softly along the corridor, listening between
his steps till the silence grew to be like a
humming in his ears.</p>

<p>And slowly, stealthily, he opened door after
door; the rooms were spacious and empty&mdash;his
lantern&rsquo;s yellow light flashing into their
corners told him this. Some poor, plain
furniture he discerned, a curtain or a bench
here and there, but not what he sought. So
large was the house, that presently it seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
to the thief that for many hours he had
been wandering along its galleries, creeping
down its wide stairs, opening the grudging
doors of the dark, empty rooms, whose
silence spoke ever more insistently in his
ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is as he told me,&rdquo; he said inwardly:
&ldquo;no living soul in all the place. The old
man&mdash;a servant of this great house&mdash;he told
me; he knew, and I have found all even
as he said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the thief turned away from the arched
emptiness of the grand staircase, and in a far
corner of the hall he found himself speaking
in a whisper because now it seemed to him
that nothing would serve but that this
clamorous silence should be stilled by a
human voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old man said it would be thus&mdash;all
emptiness, and not profit to a man; and he
died, and I tended him. Dear Jesus! how
our good deeds come home to us! And he
told me how the last of the great family had
gone away none knew whither. And the tales
I heard in the town&mdash;how the great man had
not gone, but lived here in hiding&mdash;&mdash; It is
not possible. There is the silence of death
in this house.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
He moistened his lips with his tongue.
The stillness of the place seemed to press
upon him like a solid thing. &ldquo;It is like a
dead man on one&rsquo;s shoulders,&rdquo; thought the
thief, and he straightened himself up and
whispered again: &ldquo;The old man said, &lsquo;The
door with the carved griffin, and the roses
enwreathed, and the seventh rose holds the
secret in its heart.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that the thief set forth again, creeping
softly across the bars of moonlight down the
corridor.</p>

<p>And after much seeking he found at last,
under the angle of the great stone staircase
behind a mouldering tapestry wrought with
peacocks and pines, a door, and on it carved
a griffin, wreathed about with roses. He
pressed his finger into the deep heart of each
carven rose, and when he pressed the rose
that was seventh in number from the griffin,
he felt the inmost part of it move beneath
his finger as though it sought to escape. So
he pressed more strongly, leaning against the
door till it swung open, and he passed through
it, looking behind him to see that nothing
followed. The door he closed as he entered.</p>

<p>And now he was, as it seemed, in some
other house. The chambers were large and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
lofty as those whose hushed emptiness he had
explored&mdash;but these rooms seemed warm with
life, yet held no threat, no terror. To the dim
yellow flicker from the lantern came out of the
darkness hints of a crowded magnificence, a
lavish profusion of beautiful objects such as
he had never in his life dreamed of, though
all that life had been one dream of the lovely
treasures which rich men hoard, and which,
by the thief&rsquo;s skill and craft, may come to
be his.</p>

<p>He passed through the rooms, turning the
light of his lantern this way and that, and
ever the darkness withheld more than the
light revealed. He knew that thick tapestries
hung from the walls, velvet curtains masked
the windows; his hand, exploring eagerly,
felt the rich carving of chairs and presses;
the great beds were hung with silken cloth
wrought in gold thread with glimmering
strange starry devices. Broad sideboards
flashed back to his lantern&rsquo;s questionings the
faint white laugh of silver; the tall cabinets
could not, with all their reserve, suppress the
confession of wrought gold, and, from the
caskets into whose depths he flashed the
light, came the trembling avowal of rich
jewels. And now, at last, that carved door
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
closed between him and the poignant silence
of the deserted corridors, the thief felt a
sudden gaiety of heart, a sense of escape, of
security. He was alone, yet warmed and
companioned. The silence here was no longer
a horror, but a consoler, a friend.</p>

<p>And, indeed, now he was not alone. The
ample splendours about him, the spoils which
long centuries had yielded to the grasp of a
noble family&mdash;these were companions after his
own heart.</p>

<p>He flung open the shade of his lantern and
held it high above his head. The room still
kept half its secrets. The discretion of the
darkness should be broken down. He must
see more of this splendour&mdash;not in unsatisfying
dim detail, but in the lit gorgeous mass
of it. The narrow bar of the lantern&rsquo;s light
chafed him. He sprang on to the dining-table,
and began to light the half-burnt chandelier.
There were a hundred candles, and he lighted
all, so that the chandelier swung like a vast
living jewel in the centre of the hall. Then,
as he turned, all the colour in the room leapt
out at him. The purple of the couches, the
green gleam of the delicate glass, the blue of
the tapestries, and the vivid scarlet of the
velvet hangings, and with the colour sprang
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
the gleams of white from the silver, of yellow
from the gold, of many-coloured fire from
strange inlaid work and jewelled caskets, till
the thief stood aghast with rapture in the
strange, sudden revelation of this concentrated
splendour.</p>

<p>He went along the walls with a lighted
candle in his hand&mdash;the wax dripped warm
over his fingers as he went&mdash;lighting one
after another, the tapers in the sconces of
the silver-framed glasses. In the state bedchamber
he drew back suddenly, face to face
with a death-white countenance in which
black eyes blazed at him with triumph and
delight. Then he laughed aloud. He had
not known his own face in the strange depths
of this mirror. It had no sconces like the
others, or he would have known it for what
it was. It was framed in Venice glass&mdash;wonderful,
gleaming, iridescent.</p>

<p>The thief dropped the candle and threw
his arms wide with a gesture of supreme
longing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I could carry it all away! All, all!
Every beautiful thing! To sell some&mdash;the
less beautiful, and to live with the others
all my days!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And now a madness came over the thief.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
So little a part of all these things could he
bear away with him; yet all were his&mdash;his
for the taking&mdash;even the huge carved presses
and the enormous vases of solid silver, too
heavy for him to lift&mdash;even these were his:
had he not found them&mdash;he, by his own skill
and cunning? He went about in the rooms,
touching one after the other the beautiful,
rare things. He caressed the gold and the
jewels. He threw his arms round the great
silver vases; he wound round himself the
heavy red velvet of the curtain where the
griffins gleamed in embossed gold, and
shivered with pleasure at the soft clinging
of its embrace. He found, in a tall cupboard,
curiously-shaped flasks of wine, such
wine as he had never tasted, and he drank
of it slowly&mdash;in little sips&mdash;from a silver
goblet and from a green Venice glass, and
from a cup of rare pink china, knowing that
any one of his drinking vessels was worth
enough to keep him in idleness for a long
year. For the thief had learnt his trade,
and it is a part of a thief&rsquo;s trade to know
the value of things.</p>

<p>He threw himself on the rich couches, sat
in the stately carved chairs, leaned his elbows
on the ebony tables. He buried his hot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
face in the chill, smooth linen of the great
bed, and wondered to find it still scented
delicately as though some sweet woman had
lain there but last night. He went hither
and thither laughing with pure pleasure,
and making to himself an unbridled carnival
of the joys of possession.</p>

<p>In this wise the night wore on, and with
the night his madness wore away. So
presently he went about among the treasures&mdash;no
more with the eyes of a lover, but
with the eyes of a Jew&mdash;and he chose those
precious stones which he knew for the most
precious, and put them in the bag he had
brought, and with them some fine-wrought
goldsmith&rsquo;s work and the goblet out of
which he had drunk the wine. Though it
was but of silver, he would not leave it.
The green Venice glass he broke and the cup,
for he said: &ldquo;No man less fortunate than I,
to-night, shall ever again drink from them.&rdquo;
But he harmed nothing else of all the beautiful
things, because he loved them.</p>

<p>Then, leaving the low, uneven ends of
the candles still alight, he turned to the
door by which he had come in. There
were two doors, side by side, carved with
straight lilies, and between them a panel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
wrought with the griffin and the seven
roses enwreathed. He pressed his finger
in the heart of the seventh rose, hardly
hoping that the panel would move, and
indeed it did not; and he was about to
seek for a secret spring among the lilies,
when he perceived that one of the doors
wrought with these had opened itself a
little. So he passed through it and closed
it after him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must guard my treasures,&rdquo; he said.
But when he had passed through the door
and closed it, and put out his hand to raise
the tattered tapestry that covered it from
without, his hand met the empty air, and
he knew that he had not come out by the
door through which he had entered.</p>

<p>When the lantern was lighted, it showed
him a vaulted passage, whose floor and
whose walls were stone, and there was a
damp air and a mouldering scent in it, as
of a cellar long unopened. He was cold
now, and the room with the wine and the
treasures seemed long ago and far away,
though but a door and a moment divided
him from it, and though some of the wine
was in his body, and some of the treasure
in his hands. He set about to find the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
way to the quiet night outside, for this
seemed to him a haven and a safeguard
since, with the closing of that door, he had
shut away warmth, and light, and companionship.
He was enclosed in walls once more,
and once more menaced by the invading
silence that was almost a presence. Once
more it seemed to him that he must creep
softly, must hold his breath before he
ventured to turn a corner&mdash;for always he
felt that he was not alone, that near him
was something, and that its breath, too, was
held.</p>

<p>So he went by many passages and stairways,
and could find no way out; and after
a long time of searching he crept by
another way back to come unawares on the
door which shut him off from the room
where the many lights were, and the wine
and the treasure. Then terror leaped out
upon him from the dark hush of the place,
and he beat on the door with his hands and
cried aloud, till the echo of his cry in the
groined roof cowed him back into silence.</p>

<p>Again he crept stealthily by strange
passages, and again could find no way
except, after much wandering, back to the
door where he had begun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
And now the fear of death beat in his
brain with blows like a hammer. To die
here like a rat in a trap, never to see the
sun alight again, never to climb in at a
window, or see brave jewels shine under his
lantern, but to wander, and wander, and
wander between these inexorable walls till
he died, and the rats, admitting him to their
brotherhood, swarmed round the dead body
of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had better have been born a fool,&rdquo; said
the thief.</p>

<p>Then once more he went through the damp
and the blackness of the vaulted passages,
tremulously searching for some outlet, but
in vain.</p>

<p>Only at last, in a corner behind a pillar,
he found a very little door and a stair that
led down. So he followed it, to wander
among other corridors and cellars, with the
silence heavy about him, and despair growing
thick and cold like a fungus about his heart,
and in his brain the fear of death beating
like a hammer.</p>

<p>It was quite suddenly in his wanderings,
which had grown into an aimless frenzy,
having now less of search in it than of flight
from the insistent silence, that he saw at last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
a light&mdash;and it was the light of day coming
through an open door. He stood at the door
and breathed the air of the morning. The
sun had risen and touched the tops of the
towers of the house with white radiance;
the birds were singing loudly. It was
morning, then, and he was a free man.</p>

<p>He looked about him for a way to come at
the park, and thence to the broken wall and
the white road, which he had come by a very
long time before. For this door opened on
an inner enclosed courtyard, still in damp
shadow, though the sun above struck level
across it&mdash;a courtyard where tall weeds grew
thick and dank. The dew of the night was
heavy on them.</p>

<p>As he stood and looked, he was aware of a
low, buzzing sound that came from the other
side of the courtyard. He pushed through
the weeds towards it; and the sense of a
presence in the silence came upon him more
than ever it had done in the darkened house,
though now it was day, and the birds sang
all gaily, and the good sun shone so bravely
overhead.</p>

<p>As he thrust aside the weeds which grew
waist-high, he trod on something that seemed
to writhe under his feet like a snake. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
started back and looked down. It was the
long, firm, heavy plait of a woman&rsquo;s hair.
And just beyond lay the green gown of
a woman, and a woman&rsquo;s hands, and her
golden head, and her eyes; all about the
place where she lay was the thick buzzing
of flies, and the black swarming of them.</p>

<p>The thief saw, and he turned and he fled
back to his doorway, and down the steps and
through the maze of vaulted passages&mdash;fled
in the dark, and empty-handed, because when
he had come into the presence that informed
that house with silence, he had dropped
lantern and treasure, and fled wildly, the
horror in his soul driving him before it.
Now fear is more wise than cunning, so,
whereas he had sought for hours with his
lantern and with all his thief&rsquo;s craft to find
the way out, and had sought in vain, he now,
in the dark and blindly, without thought or
will, without pause or let, found the one way
that led to a door, shot back the bolts, and
fled through the awakened rose garden and
across the dewy park.</p>

<p>He dropped from the wall into the road,
and stood there looking eagerly to right and
left. To the right the road wound white
and sinuous, like a twisted ribbon over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
great, grey shoulder of the hill; to the left
the road curved down towards the river.
No least black fly of a figure stirred on it.
There are no travellers on such a road at
such an hour.</p>

<br />
THE GIRL AT THE TOBACCONIST&rsquo;S</h2>


<p>John Selwyn Selborne cursed for the
hundredth time the fool that had bound
him captive at the chariot wheels of beauty.
That is to say, he cursed the fool he had
been to trust himself in the automobile of
that Brydges woman. The Brydges woman
was pretty, rich, and charming; omniscience
was her pose. She knew everything: consequently
she knew how to drive a motor-car.
She learned the lesson of her own
incompetence at the price of a broken ankle
and a complete suit of bruises. Selborne
paid for his trusting folly with a broken
collar-bone and a deep cut on his arm. That
was why he could not go to Portsmouth to
see the last of his young brother when he
left home for the wars.</p>

<p>This was why he cursed. The curse was
mild&mdash;it was indeed less a curse than an
invocation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
&ldquo;Defend us from women,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;above all from the women who think they
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The grey gloom that stood for dawn that
day crept through the curtains and made
ghosts of the shadows that lingered still in
his room. He stretched himself wearily, and
groaned as the stretched nerves vibrated to
the chord of agony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no fool like an old fool,&rdquo; said John
Selwyn Selborne. He had thirty-seven years,
and they weighed on him as the forty-seven
when their time came would not do.</p>

<p>He had said good-bye to the young brother
the night before; here in this country inn,
the nearest to the scene of the enlightenment
of the Brydges woman. And to-day the boy
sailed. John Selborne sighed. Twenty-two,
and off to the wars, heart-whole. Whereas
he had been invalided at the very beginning
of things and now, when he was well and
just on the point of rejoining&mdash;the motor-car
and the Brydges woman! And as for
heart-whole ... the Brydges woman again.</p>

<p>He fell asleep. When he awoke there was
full sunshine and an orchestra of awakened
birds in the garden outside. There was
tea&mdash;there were letters. One was from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
Sidney&mdash;Sidney, who had left him not twelve
hours before.</p>

<p>He tore it open, and hurt his shoulder in
the movement.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear John</span>,&rdquo; said the letter, &ldquo;I wanted
to tell you last night, but you seemed so
cheap, I thought I&rsquo;d better not bother you.
But it&rsquo;s just come into my head that perhaps
I may get a bullet in my innards, and I want
you to know. So here goes. There&rsquo;s a girl I
mean to marry. I know she&rsquo;ll say Yes, but
I can&rsquo;t ask her till I come back, of course.
I don&rsquo;t want to have any humbug or concealing
things from you; you&rsquo;ve always been
so decent to me. I know you hate jaw, so
I won&rsquo;t go on about that. But I must tell
you I met her first when she was serving
in a tobacconist&rsquo;s shop. And her mother
lets lodgings. You&rsquo;ll think this means she&rsquo;s
beneath me. Wait till you see her. I
want you to see her, and make friends with
her while I&rsquo;m away.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Here followed some lover&rsquo;s raptures, and the
address of the lady.</p>

<p>John Selborne lay back and groaned.</p>

<p>Susannah Sheepmarsh, tobacconist&rsquo;s assistant,
lodging-house keeper&rsquo;s daughter, and
Sidney Selborne, younger son of a house
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
whose pride was that it had been proud
enough to refuse a peerage.</p>

<p>John Selborne thought long and deeply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I must sacrifice myself,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Little adventuress! &lsquo;How easy to
prove to him,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;that an eagle&rsquo;s the
game her pride prefers, though she stoops
to a wren instead.&rsquo; The boy&rsquo;ll hate me for
a bit, but he&rsquo;ll thank me later. Yalding?
That&rsquo;s somewhere on the Medway. Fishing?
Boating? Convalescence is good enough.
Fiction aid us! What would the villain in
a book do to come between fond lovers? He
would take the lodgings: at least he would
try. And one may as well do something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he wrote to Mrs Sheepmarsh&mdash;she had
rooms to let, he heard. Terms? And Mrs
Sheepmarsh wrote back; at least her reply
was typewritten, which was a bit of a shock.
She had rooms. They were disengaged.
And the terms were thus and such.</p>

<p>Behold John Selwyn Selborne then, his
baggage neatly labelled with his first and
second names, set down on the little platform
of Yalding Station. Behold him, waggonette-borne,
crossing the old stone bridge and the
golden glory of the Leas, flushed with sunset.</p>

<p>Mrs Sheepmarsh&rsquo;s house was long and low
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
and white. It had a classic porch, and at
one end a French window opened through
cascades of jasmine to a long lawn. There
were many trees. A middle-aged lady in
decent black, with a white cap, and white
lace about her neck, greeted him with formal
courtesy. &ldquo;This way,&rdquo; she said, and moved
for him to follow her through a green gate
and down a shrubbery that led without
disguise or pretence straight away from the
house. It led also to a little white building
embowered in trees. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said the lady.
She opened the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell the man to
bring your luggage. Good evening&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she left him planted there. He had
to bend his head to pass under the low door,
and he found himself in a tiny kitchen.
Beyond were a sitting-room and two bedchambers.
All fitted sparsely, but with old
furniture, softly-faded curtains, quiet and
pleasant to look upon. There were roses in
a jug of Grès de Flandre on the gate-table in
the sitting-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a singular little place!&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;So these are the lodgings. I feel like a
dog in a kennel. I suppose they will throw
me a bone by-and-by&mdash;or, at any rate, ask
me what kind of bones I prefer.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
He unpacked his clothes and laid his
belongings in the drawers and cupboards; it
was oddly charming that each shelf or drawer
should have its own little muslin bag of grey
lavender. Then he took up a book and began
to read. The sunset had died away, the daylight
seemed to be glowing out of the low
window like a tide, leaving bare breadths of
darkness behind. He lighted candles. He
was growing hungry&mdash;it was past eight
o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe the old lady has forgotten my
existence,&rdquo; he said, and therewith opened his
cottage door and went out into the lighter
twilight of the garden. The shrubbery walks
were winding. He took the wrong turning,
and found himself entering on the narrow
lawn. From the French window among the
jasmine came lamplight&mdash;and voices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No servant, no food? My good mother,
you&rsquo;ve entertained a lunatic unawares.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had references.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man cannot live by references alone.
The poor brute must be starving&mdash;unless
he&rsquo;s drunk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Celia! I do wish you wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Selborne hastening by, put a period to
the conversation by boots crunching heavily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
and conscientiously on the gravel. Both voices
ceased. He presented himself at the lamp-lit
oblong of the window.</p>

<p>Within that lamplight glowed on the last
remnants of a meal&mdash;dinner, by the glasses
and the fruit. Also on the lady in the cap,
and on a girl&mdash;the one, doubtless, who had
evolved the lunatic idea. Both faces were
turned towards him. Both women rose:
there was nothing for it but advance. He
murmured something about intrusion&mdash;&ldquo;awfully
sorry, the walks wind so,&rdquo; and
turned to go.</p>

<p>But the girl spoke: &ldquo;Oh, wait a moment.
Is this Mr Selwyn, mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My daughter, Miss Sheepmarsh&mdash;Mr
Selwyn,&rdquo; said the mother reluctantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were just talking about you,&rdquo; said
the girl, &ldquo;and wondering whether you were
ill or anything, or whether your servant hasn&rsquo;t
turned up, or something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Sheepmarsh.&rdquo; He was still speechless.
This the little adventuress, the tobacconist&rsquo;s
assistant? This girl with the glorious hair
severely braided, the round face, the proud
chin, the most honest eyes in the world?
She might be sister to the adventuress&mdash;cousin,
perhaps? But the room, too&mdash;shining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
mahogany, old china, worn silver, and fine
napery&mdash;all spoke of a luxury as temperate
as refined: the luxury of delicate custom, of
habit bred in the bone; no mushroom growth
of gross self-indulgence, but the unconscious
outcome of generations of clear self-respect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can we send anything over for you?&rdquo; the
elder lady asked. &ldquo;Of course we&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t mean by &lsquo;entirely private&rsquo; that
we would let our tenant starve,&rdquo; the girl
interrupted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is some mistake.&rdquo; Selborne came to
himself suddenly. &ldquo;I thought I was engaging
furnished apartments with er&mdash;attendance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl drew a journal from a heap on
the sofa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This was the advertisement, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>

<p>And he read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Four-roomed cottage, furnished, in beautiful
grounds. Part of these are fenced in for
use of tenant of cottage. And in the absence
of the family the whole of the grounds are
open to tenant. When at home the family
wish to be entirely private.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;I never saw this at all,&rdquo; said Selborne
desperately. &ldquo;My&mdash;I mean I was told it
was furnished lodgings. I am very sorry I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
have no servant and no means of getting
one. I will go back to London at once.
I am sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The last train&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; said Miss Sheepmarsh.
&ldquo;Mother, ask Mr Selborne to come
in, and I&rsquo;ll get him something to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said the mother, &ldquo;surely
Mary&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear mother,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;you
know Mary is having her supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bewildered Selborne presently found
himself seated at the white-spread, silver-sparkling
table, served with food and drink
by this Hebe with the honest eyes. He
exerted himself to talk with the mother&mdash;not
of the difference between a lodger and
a tenant, but of music, art, and the life of
the great world.</p>

<p>It was the girl who brought the conversation
down from the gossip of Courts and
concert-rooms to the tenant&rsquo;s immediate
needs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you mean to stay, you could have a
woman in from the village,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But wouldn&rsquo;t you rather I went?&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should we? We want to let the
cottage, or we shouldn&rsquo;t have advertised it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
I&rsquo;ll get you some one to-morrow. Mrs Bates
would be the very thing, mother. And
you&rsquo;ll like her, Mr Selwyn. She&rsquo;s a great
dear&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sure enough, the next morning brought
a gentle, middle-aged woman to &ldquo;do for&rdquo;
Mr Selwyn. And she did excellently. And
three slow days passed. He got a boat and
pulled up and down the green willow-fringed
river. He tried to fish; he read somewhat,
and he thought more. And he went in and
out of his cottage, which had its own private
path debouching on the highway. Many
times a day he went in and out, but he
saw no more the red hair, the round face,
and the honest eyes.</p>

<p>On the fourth day he had nursed his
interest in the girl to a strong, well-grown
sentiment of curiosity and attraction. Coming
in at his own gate, he saw the mother leaving
hers, with sunshade and cardcase&mdash;an afternoon
of calls evidently setting in.</p>

<p>Now or never! The swift impulse took
him, and before he had time to recall
the terms of that advertisement, he had
passed the green fence of division, and his
feet were on the wandering ways of the
shrubbery. He felt, as he went, a glow of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
gratitude to the fate which was rewarding
his care of his brother&rsquo;s future with an interest
like this. The adventuress?&mdash;the tobacconist&rsquo;s
assistant?&mdash;he could deal with her later.</p>

<p>Through the garden&rsquo;s green a gleam of
white guided&mdash;even, it seemed, beckoned.</p>

<p>He found the girl with the red hair and
the honest eyes in a hammock swung between
two cedars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have pity on me,&rdquo; he said abruptly.</p>

<p>She raised her eyes from her book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am so glad.
Get a chair from under the weeping ash, and
sit down and talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This turf is good enough for me,&rdquo; said
he; &ldquo;but are you sure I&rsquo;m not trespassing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean the advertisement? Oh, that
was just because we had some rather awful
people last year, and we couldn&rsquo;t get away
from them, and mother wanted to be quite
safe; but, of course, you&rsquo;re different. We
like you very much, what we&rsquo;ve seen of you.&rdquo;
This straightforward compliment somehow
pleased him less than it might have done.
&ldquo;The other people were&mdash;well, he was a
butterman. I believe he called himself an
artist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that you do not like persons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
who are in trade,&rdquo; he asked, thinking of the
tobacconist&rsquo;s assistant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;why, I&rsquo;m a Socialist! Butterman just means
a person without manners or ideals. But I
do like working people better than shoppy
people, though I know it&rsquo;s wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can an involuntary liking or disliking
be wrong?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s snobbish, don&rsquo;t you think? We
ought to like people for what they are, not
for what they have, or what they work at.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you weren&rsquo;t so pretty, and hadn&rsquo;t that
delightful air of having just embraced the
Social Gospel, you&rsquo;d be a prig,&rdquo; he said to
himself. To her he said: &ldquo;Roughly speaking,
don&rsquo;t you think the conventional classifications
correspond fairly well with the real ones?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered roundly.</p>

<p>And when the mother returned, weary
from her calls, she found her tenant and
her daughter still discussing the problems
of good and evil, of heredity and environment,
of social inequalities and the injustice
of the world. The girl fought for her views,
and she fought fairly, if fiercely. It was
the first of many such fights. When he
had gone the mother protested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
&ldquo;Dearest,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it!
I must live my own life, as people say
in plays. After all, I&rsquo;m twenty-six. I&rsquo;ve
always talked to people if I liked them&mdash;even
strangers in railway carriages. And
people aren&rsquo;t wild beasts, you know: everything
is always all right. And this man can
talk; he knows about things. And he&rsquo;s a
gentleman. That ought to satisfy you&mdash;that
and his references. Don&rsquo;t worry, there&rsquo;s
a darling. Just be nice to him yourself. He&rsquo;s
simply a godsend in a place like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll fall in love with you, Celia,&rdquo; said
the mother warningly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not he!&rdquo; said the daughter. But the
mother was right.</p>

<p>Living alone in the queer little cottage,
the world, his accustomed life, the Brydges
woman, all seemed very far away. Miss
Sheepmarsh was very near. Her frank enjoyment
of his talk, her gay acceptance of their
now almost constant companionship, were
things new in his experience of women, and
might have warned him that she at least
was heart-whole. They would have done
had he ever faced the fact that his own
heart had caught fire. He bicycled with
her along the pleasant Kentish lanes; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
rowed with her on the little river of dreams;
he read to her in the quiet of the August
garden; he gave himself up wholly to the
pleasure of those hours that flew like moments&mdash;those
days that passed like hours. They
talked of books and of the heart of books&mdash;and
inevitably they talked of themselves.
He talked of himself less than most men,
but he learned much of her life. She was
an ardent social reformer; had lived in an
Art-and-Culture-for-the-People settlement in
Whitechapel; had studied at the London
School of Economics. Now she had come
back to be with her mother, who needed
her. She and her mother were almost alone
in the world; there was enough to live on,
but not too much. The letting of the little
house had been Celia&rsquo;s idea: its rent was
merely for &ldquo;luxuries.&rdquo; He found out from
the mother, when she came to tolerate him,
that the &ldquo;luxuries&rdquo; were Celia&rsquo;s&mdash;the luxuries
of helping the unfortunate, feeding the hungry,
and clothing little shivering children in winter
time.</p>

<p>And all this while he had not heard a word
of sister or cousin&mdash;of any one whom he might
identify as the tobacconist&rsquo;s assistant.</p>

<p>It was on an evening when the level sunbeams
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
turned the meadows by the riverside
to fine gold, and the willows and alders to
trees of Paradise, that he spoke suddenly,
leaning forward on his sculls. &ldquo;Have you,&rdquo;
he asked, looking into her face, &ldquo;any relation
who is in a shop?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only wondered,&rdquo; said he coldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what an extraordinary thing to
wonder!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do tell me what made
you think of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will. The person
who told me that your mother had lodgings,
also told me that your mother had a daughter
who served in a shop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;What a hateful
idea!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A tobacconist&rsquo;s shop,&rdquo; he persisted; &ldquo;and
her name was Susannah Sheepmarsh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;that was me.&rdquo; She
spoke instantly and frankly, but she blushed
crimson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re ashamed of it,&mdash;Socialist?&rdquo;
he asked with a sneer, and his eyes were
fierce on her burning face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not! Row home, please. Or I&rsquo;ll
take the sculls if you&rsquo;re tired, or your
shoulder hurts. I don&rsquo;t want to talk to you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
any more. You tried to trap me into telling
a lie. You don&rsquo;t understand anything at all.
And I&rsquo;ll never forgive you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you will,&rdquo; he said to himself again
and again through the silence in which they
plashed down the river. But when he
was alone in his cottage, the truth flew at
him and grappled him with teeth and claws.
He loved her. She loved, or had loved&mdash;or
might have loved&mdash;or might love&mdash;his
brother. He must go: and the next
morning he went without a word. He left
a note for Mrs Sheepmarsh, and a cheque
in lieu of notice; and letter and cheque were
signed with his name in full.</p>

<p>He went back to the old life, but the taste
of it all was gone. Shooting parties, house
parties, the Brydges woman even, prettier
than ever, and surer of all things: how could
these charm one whose fancy, whose heart
indeed, wandered for ever in a green garden
or by a quiet river with a young woman
who had served in a tobacconist&rsquo;s shop, and
who would be some day his brother&rsquo;s wife?</p>

<p>The days were long, the weeks seemed
interminable. And all the time there was
the white house, as it had been; there were
mother and daughter living the same dainty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
dignified, charming life to which he had
come so near. Why had he ever gone
there? Why had he ever interfered? He
had meant to ensnare her heart just to
free his brother from an adventuress. An
adventuress! He groaned aloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, fool! But you are punished!&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s angry now&mdash;angrier even than
that evening on the river, for she knows
now that even the name you gave her to
call you by was not the one your own
people use. This comes of trying to act like
an ass in a book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The months went on. The Brydges woman
rallied him on his absent air. She spoke of
dairymaids. He wondered how he could ever
have found her amusing, and whether her
vulgarity was a growth, or had been merely
hidden.</p>

<p>And all the time Celia and the white
house were dragging at his heart-strings.
Enough was left of the fool that he constantly
reproached himself for having been,
to make him sure that had he had no brother,
had he met her with no duty to the absent
to stand between them she would have loved
him.</p>

<p>Then one day came the South African
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
mail, and it brought a letter from his brother,
the lad who had had the sense to find a
jewel behind a tobacconist&rsquo;s counter, and had
trusted it to him.</p>

<p>The letter was long and ineffective. It
was the postscript that was vital.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;I say, I wonder whether you&rsquo;ve seen anything
of Susannah? What a young fool I
was ever to think I could be happy with a
girl out of a shop. I&rsquo;ve met the real and
only one now&mdash;she&rsquo;s a nurse; her father was
a clergyman in Northumberland. She&rsquo;s such
a bright little thing, and she&rsquo;s never cared for
any one before me. Wish me luck.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>John Selborne almost tore his hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t save him across half the
world! Besides&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>At thirty-seven one should have outgrown
the wild impulses of youth. He said this
to himself, but all the same it was the next
train to Yalding that he took.</p>

<p>Fate was kind; at Yalding it had almost
always been kind. The glow of red firelight
shone out over the snow through the French
window among the brown jasmine stalks.</p>

<p>Mrs Sheepmarsh was out, Miss Sheepmarsh
was at home. Would he step this way?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
He stepped into the presence of the girl.
She rose from the low chair by the fire, and
the honest eyes looked angrily at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, as the door closed
between them and the maid-servant, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
come to tell you things. Just this once let
me talk to you; and afterwards, if you
like, I can go away and never come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; she said coldly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
feel friends with you at all, but if you want
to speak, I suppose you must.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So then he told her everything, beginning
with his brother&rsquo;s letter, and ending with his
brother&rsquo;s letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, of course, I thought it couldn&rsquo;t be
you, because of your being called Celia; and
when I found out it really was you, I had
to go away, because I wanted to be fair to
the boy. But now I&rsquo;ve come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re the meanest person I ever
knew,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you thought I liked your
brother, and you tried to make me like you
so that you might throw me over and show
him how worthless I was. I hate you and
despise you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t really try,&rdquo; he said miserably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you took a false name to deceive us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t: it really is my second name.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
&ldquo;And you came here pretending to be nice
and a gentleman, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She was lashing
herself to rage, with the lash of her own
voice, as women will. John Selborne stood
up suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet,&rdquo; he said, and she was quiet. &ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t hear any more reproaches, unless&mdash;&mdash; Listen,
I&rsquo;ve done wrong&mdash;I&rsquo;ve owned it.
I&rsquo;ve suffered for it. God knows I&rsquo;ve suffered.
You liked me in the summer: can&rsquo;t you
try to like me again? I want you more
than anything else in the world. Will you
marry me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marry you,&rdquo; she cried scornfully; &ldquo;you
who&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have asked
a question. Give me no for an answer, and
I will go. Say yes, and then you may say
anything else you like. Yes or no. Shall
I go or stay? Yes or no. No other word
will do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him, her head thrown back,
her eyes flashing with indignation. A world
of scorn showed in the angle of the chin,
the poise of her head. Her lips opened.
Then suddenly her eyes met his, and she
knew that he meant what he said. She
covered her face with her hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t cry, dear one,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;What is it? You&rsquo;ve only to choose.
Everything is for you to decide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still she did not speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, then,&rdquo; he said, and turned.
But she caught at him blindly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t go!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
think I cared about you in the summer,
but since you went away, oh, you don&rsquo;t
know how I&rsquo;ve wanted you!&rdquo;</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, when her tears were dried,
&ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you going to scold me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least tell me all about my brother&mdash;and
why he thought you would be so ready
to marry him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That? Oh, that was only his conceit.
You know I always do talk to people in
railway carriages and things. I suppose he
thought it was only him I talked to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I thought if I said my name was
Susannah he wouldn&rsquo;t get sentimental.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You &lsquo;took a false name to deceive
him&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;oh, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the tobacco shop?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
&ldquo;Ah&mdash;that rankles?&rdquo; She raised her head
to look at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not it,&rdquo; he answered coolly. &ldquo;I simply
don&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why? But you&rsquo;re quite right. It was
a woman in my district in London, and I took
the shop for her for three days, because her
husband was dying, and she couldn&rsquo;t get any
one else to help her. It was&mdash;it was rather
fun&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you wouldn&rsquo;t tell me about it,
because you didn&rsquo;t want me to know how
proud you were of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Proud? Ah, you do understand things!
The man died, and I had given her those
three days with him. I wasn&rsquo;t proud, was I?&mdash;only
glad that I could. So glad&mdash;so
glad!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you let my brother think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I let him think it was my
trade; I thought it might make him not
be silly. You see, I always knew he
couldn&rsquo;t understand things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Celia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And have you really forgiven me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I forgive you! But I never
should have if&mdash;&mdash; There&rsquo;s mother at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
front door. Let me go. I want to let
her in myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me go. If&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t understood and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t come back to me!&rdquo;</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="padtop smlpadb">XII<br />
<br />
WHILE IT IS YET DAY</h2>


<p>&ldquo;And is it really true? Are you going to
govern the Fortunate Islands?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am, indeed&mdash;or rather, to be accurate,
I am going to deputy-govern them&mdash;I mean,
father is&mdash;for a year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A whole year!&rdquo; he said, looking down
at her fan. &ldquo;What will London do without
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;London will do excellently,&rdquo; she answered&mdash;&ldquo;and
that&rsquo;s my pet fan, and it&rsquo;s not used to
being tied into knots.&rdquo; She took it from him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what shall I do without you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! laugh and rhyme and dance and
dine. You&rsquo;ll go out to the proper number
of dinners and dances, and make the proper
measure of pretty little speeches and nice
little phrases; and you&rsquo;ll do your reviews, and
try to make them as like your editor&rsquo;s as you
can; and you&rsquo;ll turn out your charming little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
rondeaux and triolets, and the year will simply
fly. Heigho! I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m going to see
something big, if it&rsquo;s only the Atlantic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very cruel,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I? But it&rsquo;s not cruel to be cruel if
nobody&rsquo;s hurt, is it? And I am so tired of
nice little verses and pretty little dances and
dainty little dinners. Oh, if I were only a
man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God you&rsquo;re not!&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I were a man, I would do just one
big thing in my life, even if I had to settle
down to a life of snippets and trifles afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes were shining. They always
glittered, but now they were starry. The
drifted white folds across her breast stirred
to her quickened breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you loved me, Sybil, I could do something
great!&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I <i>don&rsquo;t</i>,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;at any rate,
not now; and I&rsquo;ve told you so a dozen
times. My dear Rupert, the man who
needs a woman to save him isn&rsquo;t worth the
saving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would you call a big thing?&rdquo; he
asked. &ldquo;Must I conquer an empire for you,
or start a new religion? Or shall I merely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
get the Victoria Cross, or become Prime
Minister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sneer,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t
become you at all. You&rsquo;ve no idea how
horrid you look when you&rsquo;re sneering. Why
don&rsquo;t you&mdash;&mdash;? Oh! but it&rsquo;s no good! By
the way, what a charming cover Housman
has designed for your <i>Veils and Violets</i>!
It&rsquo;s a dear little book. Some of the verses
are quite pretty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;rub it in. I know I
haven&rsquo;t done much yet; but there&rsquo;s plenty
of time. And how can one do any good
work when one is for ever sticking up one&rsquo;s
heart like a beastly cocoanut for you to shy
at? If you&rsquo;d only marry me, Sybil, you
should see how I would work!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I refer you to my speech&mdash;not the
last one, but the one before that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed; then he sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my Pretty,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it was all very
well, and pleasant enough to be scolded by
you when I could see you every day; but
now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How often,&rdquo; she asked calmly, &ldquo;have I
told you that you must not call me that?
It was all very well when we were children;
but now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, leaning towards her,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s not a soul about; they&rsquo;re in the
middle of the Lancers. Let me kiss you once&mdash;it
can&rsquo;t matter to you&mdash;and it will mean so
very much to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;if it didn&rsquo;t
mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it shan&rsquo;t mean anything but good-bye.
It&rsquo;s only about eight years since you
gave up the habit of kissing me on every
occasion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked down, then she looked to right
and left, then suddenly she looked at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have it unless it
<i>does</i> mean something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a silence. &ldquo;Our dance, I think?&rdquo;
said the voice of one bending before her, and
she was borne away on the arm of the partner
from whom she had been hiding.</p>

<p>Rupert left early. He had not been able
to secure any more dances with her. She
left late. When she came to think the
evening over, she sighed more than once.
&ldquo;I wish I loved him a little less, or a little
more,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and I wish&mdash;yes, I do
wish he had. I don&rsquo;t suppose he&rsquo;ll care a
bit for me when I come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
So she set sail for the Fortunate or other
Isles, and in dainty verses on loss and absence
he found some solace for the pain of parting
with her. Yet the pain was a real thing,
and grew greater, and life seemed to have
no taste, even tobacco no charm. She had
always been a part of his life since the days
when nothing but a sunk fence divided his
father&rsquo;s park from her father&rsquo;s rabbit-warren.
He grew paler, and he developed a wrinkle
or two, and a buoyant friend meeting him
in Piccadilly assured him that he looked very
much off colour, and in his light-hearted way
the friend advised the sort of trip round the
world from which yesterday had seen his own
jovial return.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you all the good in the world, my
boy. &rsquo;Pon my soul, you have a tired sort of
look, as if you&rsquo;d got some of these jolly new
diseases people have taken to dying of lately&mdash;appendi-what&rsquo;s-its-name,
you know, and
things like that. You book your passage to
Marseilles at once. So long! You take my
tip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What Rupert took was a cab. He looked
at himself in one of the little horseshoe mirrors.
He certainly did look ill; and he felt ill&mdash;tired,
bored, and nothing seemed worth while.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
He drove to a doctor friend, who punched
and prodded him and listened with tubes at
his chest and back, looked grave, and said: &ldquo;Go
to Strongitharm&mdash;he&rsquo;s absolutely at <i>the</i> top.
Twenty-guinea fee. But it&rsquo;s better to know
where we are. You go to Strongitharm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rupert went, and Strongitharm gave his
opinion. He gave it with a voice that
trembled with sympathy, and he supplemented
it with brandy-and-soda, which he
happened to have quite handy.</p>

<p>Then Rupert disappeared from London
and from his friends&mdash;disappeared suddenly
and completely. He had plenty of money,
and no relations near enough to be inconveniently
anxious. He went away and he
left no address, and he did not even write
excuses to the people with whom he should
have danced and dined, nor to the editor
whose style he should have gone on imitating.</p>

<p>The buoyant friend rejoiced at the obvious
and natural following of his advice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was looking a little bit below himself,
you know, and I said: &lsquo;Go round the world;
there&rsquo;s nothing like it,&rsquo; and, by Jove! he
went. Now, that&rsquo;s the kind of man I like&mdash;knows
good advice when he gets it, and
acts on it right off.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
So the buoyant one spread the rumour that
ran its course and died, and had to be
galvanised into life once more to furnish an
answer to Sybil&rsquo;s questionings, when, returning
from the Fortunate or other Isles, she asked
for news of her old friend. And the rumour
did not satisfy her. She had had time to
think&mdash;there was plenty of time to think in
those Islands whose real name escapes me&mdash;and
she knew very much more than she
had known on the evening when Rupert
had broken her pet fan and asked for a kiss
which he had not taken. She found herself
quite fervently disbelieving in the grand tour
theory&mdash;and the disbelief was so strong that
it distorted life and made everything else
uninteresting. Sybil took to novel-reading
as other folks have in their time taken to
drink. She was young, and she could still
lose herself in a book. One day she lost
herself most completely in a new novel from
Mudie&rsquo;s, a book that every one was talking
about. She lost herself; and suddenly, in a
breathless joy that was agony too, she found
<i>him</i>. This was his book. No one but Rupert
could have written it&mdash;all that description of
the park, and the race when she rode the
goat and he rode the pig&mdash;and&mdash;she turned the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
pages hastily. Ah yes, Rupert had written
this! She put the book down and she dressed
herself as prettily as she knew how, and she
went in a hansom cab to the office of the
publisher of that book, and on the way she
read. And more and more she saw how
great a book it was, and how no one but
Rupert could have written just that book.
Thrill after thrill of pride ran through her.
He had done this <i>for her</i>&mdash;because of what
she had said.</p>

<p>Arrived at the publisher&rsquo;s, she was met by
a blank wall. Neither partner was visible.
The senior clerk did not know the address
of the author of &ldquo;Work While it is Yet Day,&rdquo;
nor the name of him; and it was abundantly
evident that even if he had known, he
would not have told.</p>

<p>Sybil&rsquo;s prettiness and her charm so wrought
upon this dry-as-dust person, however, that
he volunteered the address of the literary
agent through whom the book had been
purchased. And Sybil found him on a first
floor in one of those imposing new buildings
in Arundel Street. He was very nice and
kind, but he could not give his client&rsquo;s name
without his client&rsquo;s permission.</p>

<p>The disappointment was bitter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll send a letter for you,&rdquo; he tried
to soften it with.</p>

<p>Sybil&rsquo;s self-control almost gave way. A
tear glistened on her veil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do want to see him most awfully,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;and I know he wants to see me. It
was I who rode the goat in the book, you
know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not realise how much she was
admitting, but the literary agent did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said smartly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wire
to him at once; and if he says I may, I&rsquo;ll
give you the address. Can you call in
an hour?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sybil wandered on the Embankment for
a conscientious hour, and then went back.</p>

<p>The literary agent smiled victory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The answer is &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said, and handed
her a slip of paper&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">&ldquo;Three Chimneys,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Near Paddock Wood,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Kent.&rdquo;</span></span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Have you a time-table?&rdquo; asked she.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The dusty, hired fly lumbered and jolted
along the white roads, and in it, as in the
train, Sybil read the novel, the book every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
one was talking about&mdash;the great book&mdash;and
her heart was full to overflowing of joy and
pride and other things.</p>

<p>The carriage shook itself fiercely and
stopped, and she looked up from the last
page of the book with eyes that swam a
little, to find herself at the broken wooden
gate of a low, white house, shabbily blindless,
and a long way off its last painting and
whitewashing.</p>

<p>She paid for the carriage and dismissed it.
She would walk back to the station with
<i>him</i>. She passed in at the rickety gate and
up the flagged path, and a bell in answer
to her touch jangled loudly, as bells do in
empty houses.</p>

<p>Her dress was greeny, with lace about it
of the same colour as very nice biscuits,
and her hat seemed to be made entirely of
yellow roses. She was not unconscious of
these facts.</p>

<p>Steps sounded within, and they, like the
bell, seemed to sound in an empty house.
The door opened, and there was Rupert.
Sybil&rsquo;s lips were half-parted in a smile that
should match the glow of gladness that must
shine on his face when he saw her&mdash;Her&mdash;the
unattainable, the unapproachable, at his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
very door. But her smile died away, for
his face was grave. Only in his eyes something
that was bright and fierce and like a
flame leapt up and shone a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>And Sybil answered as most people do
to such questions: &ldquo;Yes, me.&rdquo; There was
a pause: her eyes wandered from his to the
blank face of the house, the tangle of the
untidy garden. &ldquo;Mayn&rsquo;t I come in?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; oh yes, come in!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She crossed the threshold&mdash;the doorstep
was dank with green mould&mdash;and followed
him into a room. It was a large room, and
perfectly bare: no carpet, no curtains, no
pictures. Loose bricks were arranged as a
fender, and dead embers strewed the hearth.
There was a table; there was a chair; there
were scattered papers, pens, and ink. From
the window one saw the neglected garden,
and beyond it the round shoulders of the
hills.</p>

<p>He drew forward the one chair, and she
sat down. He stood with his back to the
fireless grate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very, very pretty,&rdquo; he said
suddenly. And the explanation of his disappearance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
suddenly struck her like a blow
between the eyes. But she was not afraid.
When all a woman&rsquo;s thoughts, day and night
for a year, have been given to one man,
she is not afraid of him; no, not even if
he be what Sybil for one moment feared
that this man was. He read the fear in her
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not mad,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Sybil,
I&rsquo;m very glad you came. Come to think
of it, I&rsquo;m very glad to see you. It is better
than writing. I was just going to write out
everything, as well as I could. I expect I
should have sent it to you. You know I
used to care for you more than I did for
any one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sybil&rsquo;s hands gripped the arms of the
windsor chair. Was he really&mdash;was it
through her that he was&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come out,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I hate this place;
it stifles me. And you&rsquo;ve lived here&mdash;worked
here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lived here for eleven months and
three days,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yes, come out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they went out through the burning
July sun, and Sybil found a sheltered spot
between a larch and a laburnum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, throwing off her hat and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
curling her green, soft draperies among the long
grass. &ldquo;Come and sit down and tell me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He threw himself on the grass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure it won&rsquo;t bore you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>She took his hand and held it. He let her
take it; but his hand did not hold hers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I seem to remember,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the last
time I saw you&mdash;you were going away, or
something. You told me I ought to do
something great; and I told you&mdash;or, anyway,
I thought to myself&mdash;that there was
plenty of time for that. I&rsquo;d always had a
sort of feeling that I <i>could</i> do something
great whenever I chose to try. Well&mdash;yes,
you did go away, of course; I remember
perfectly&mdash;and I missed you extremely. And
some one told me I looked ill; and I went
to my doctor, and he sent me to a big swell,
and <i>he</i> said I&rsquo;d only got about a year to
live. So then I began to think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her fingers tightened on the unresponsive
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I thought: Here I&rsquo;ve been thirty
years in this world. I&rsquo;ve the experience of
twenty-eight and a half&mdash;I suppose the first
little bit doesn&rsquo;t count. If I&rsquo;d had time, I
meant to write another book, just to show
exactly what a man feels when he knows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
he&rsquo;s only got a year to live, and nothing
done&mdash;nothing done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t <i>look</i> ill; you&rsquo;re as lean as a greyhound,
but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may come any day now,&rdquo; he went on
quietly; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve done something. The
book&mdash;it <i>is</i> great. They all say so; and I
know it, too. But at first! Just think of
gasping out your breath, and feeling that
all the things you had seen and known and
felt were wasted&mdash;lost&mdash;going out with you,
and that you were going out like the flame
of a candle, taking everything you might
have done with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The book <i>is</i> great,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you <i>have</i>
done something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. But for those two days I stayed
in my rooms in St James&rsquo;s Street, and I
thought, and thought, and thought, and
there was no one to care where I went or
what I did, except a girl who was fond of
me when she was little, and she had gone
away and wasn&rsquo;t fond of me any more. Oh,
Sybil&mdash;I feel like a lunatic&mdash;I mean you,
of course; but you never cared. And I
went to a house agent&rsquo;s and got the house
unfurnished, and I bought the furniture&mdash;there&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
nothing much except what you&rsquo;ve
seen, and a bed and a bath, and some pots
and kettles; and I&rsquo;ve lived alone in that
house, and I&rsquo;ve written that book, with
Death sitting beside me, jogging my elbow
every time I stopped writing, and saying,
&lsquo;Hurry up; I&rsquo;m waiting here for you, and
I shall have to take you away, and you&rsquo;ll
have done nothing, nothing, nothing.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve done the book,&rdquo; said Sybil
again. The larch and the garden beyond
were misty to her eyes. She set her teeth.
He must be comforted. Her own agony&mdash;that
could be dealt with later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve ridden myself with the curb,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I thought it all out&mdash;proper food,
proper sleep, proper exercise. I wouldn&rsquo;t
play the fool with the last chance; and I
pulled it off. I wrote the book in four
months; and every night, when I went to
sleep, I wondered whether I should ever
wake to go on with the book. But I did
wake, and then I used to leap up and thank
God, and set to work; and I&rsquo;ve done it.
The book will live&mdash;every one says it will.
I shan&rsquo;t have lived for nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rupert,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;dear Rupert!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said forlornly; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
very kind.&rdquo; And he drew his limp hand
from hers, and leaned his elbows on the
grass and his chin on his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Rupert, why didn&rsquo;t you write and
tell me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the use of making you sad?
You were always sorry for maimed things&mdash;even
the worms the gardener cut in two
with his spade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was struggling with a growing desire
to scream and shriek, and to burst out
crying and tear the grass with her hands.
He no longer loved her&mdash;that was the lesser
evil. She could have borne that&mdash;have borne
anything. But he was going to die! The
intensity of her belief that he was going to
die caught her by the throat. She defended
herself instinctively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you&rsquo;re going to die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed; and when the echo of that
laugh had died away in the quiet garden,
she found that she could no longer even say
that she did not believe.</p>

<p>Then he said: &ldquo;I am going to die, and
all the values of things have changed places.
But I have done something: I haven&rsquo;t buried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
my talent in a napkin. Oh, my Pretty, go
away, go away! You make a fool of me
again! I had almost forgotten how to be
sorry that you couldn&rsquo;t love me. Go away,
go away! Go, go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He threw out his hands, and they lay
along the grass. His face went down into
the tangled green, and she saw his shoulders
shaken with sobs. She dragged herself along
the grass till she was close to him; then
she lifted his shoulders, and drew his head
on to her lap, and clasped her arms round
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My darling, my dear, my own!&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re tired, and you&rsquo;ve thought of nothing
but your hateful book&mdash;your beautiful book,
I mean&mdash;but you do love me really. Not as
I love you, but still you do love me. Oh,
Rupert, I&rsquo;ll nurse you, I&rsquo;ll take care of you,
I&rsquo;ll be your slave; and if you have to die, I
shall die too, because there&rsquo;ll be nothing left
for me to do for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He put an arm round her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth
dying to hear that,&rdquo; he said, and brought his
face to lie against her waist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you shan&rsquo;t die. You must come back
to London with me now&mdash;this minute. The
best opinion&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
&ldquo;I had the best,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Kiss me, my
Pretty; oh, kiss me now that it does mean
something! Let me dream that I&rsquo;m going
to live, and that you love me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He lifted his face, and she kissed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rupert, you&rsquo;re <i>not</i> going to die. It can&rsquo;t
be true. It isn&rsquo;t true. It shan&rsquo;t be true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is; but I don&rsquo;t mind now, except for
you. I&rsquo;m a selfish beast. But this is worth
it all, and I <i>have</i> done something great. You
told me to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;who was the doctor?
Was he really the best?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Strongitharm,&rdquo; he said wearily.</p>

<p>She drew a long breath and clasped him
closer. Then she pushed him away and
sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand up!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Let me look at
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stood up, and she caught him by the
elbows and stood looking at him. Twice she
tried to speak, and twice no voice obeyed;
then she said softly, huskily: &ldquo;Rupert, listen!
It&rsquo;s all a horrid dream. Wake up. Haven&rsquo;t
you seen the papers? Strongitharm went mad
several months ago. It was drink. He told
<i>all</i> his patients they were going to die of this
new disease of his that he&rsquo;d invented. It&rsquo;s all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
his madness. You&rsquo;re well&mdash;I know it. Oh,
Rupert, you aren&rsquo;t going to die, and we love
each other! Oh, God is very good!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew a long breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure? It&rsquo;s like coming back from
chloroform; and yet it hurts, and yet&mdash;but I
wrote the book! Oh, Sybil, I shall never
write another great book!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah yes, you will&mdash;you shall,&rdquo; she said,
looking at him with wet eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Oh, thank God,
I have you! but I shall never write another
great book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he never has.</p>

<p>But he is very happy. And Sybil cannot
see that his later works are not in the same
field with the first. She thinks the critics
fools. And he loves her the more for her
folly.</p>

<h2 class="padtop smlpadb">XIII<br />
<br />
ALCIBIADES</h2>


<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>do</i> let me have him in the carriage
with me; he won&rsquo;t hurt any one, he&rsquo;s a perfect
angel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Angels like him travels in the dog-box,&rdquo;
said the porter.</p>

<p>Judy ended an agonised search for her
pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you be offended,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if
I offered you half-a-crown?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give the guard a bob, Miss.&rdquo; The hand
curved into a cup resting on the carriage
window, answered her question. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more&rsquo;n
enough for him, being a single man, whereas
me, I&rsquo;m risking my situation and nine children
at present to say no more, when I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The turn of a railway key completed the
sentence.</p>

<p>Judy and the angel were alone. He was
a very nice angel&mdash;long-haired and brownly-black&mdash;his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
race the Aberdeen, his name
Alcibiades. He put up a respectful and
adoring nose, and his mistress kissed him
between the eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could they try to part us,&rdquo; she
asked, &ldquo;when there&rsquo;s only us two left?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alcibiades, with swimming eyes, echoed
in a little moan of true love the question:
&ldquo;How could they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The question was put again by both later
in the day. Judy was to stay with an aunt
while her mother sailed to Madeira to meet
there the father returning from South Africa,
full of wounds and honour, and to spend on
the Island what was left of the winter. Now
it was December.</p>

<p>A thick fog covered London with a veil
of ugliness; the cabman was aggrieved and
aggrieving&mdash;Alcibiades had tried to bite him&mdash;and
Judy was on the verge of tears when
the fog at last lifted, and allowed her to be
driven to her aunt&rsquo;s suburban house, yellow
brickish, with a slate roof and a lean forecourt,
wherein cypresses, stunted and blackened,
spoke eloquently of lives more blank than the
death whose emblem they were.</p>

<p>Through the slits of the drab Venetian
blinds, gaslight streamed into the winter dusk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be tea, anyhow,&rdquo; sighed Judy,
recklessly overpaying the cabman.</p>

<p>Inside the house where the lights were,
the Aunt was surrounded by a dozen ladies
of about her own age and station; &ldquo;Tabbies&rdquo;
the world might have called them. All were
busy with mysteries of many coloured silks
and satins, lace and linen; at least all held
such in their hands. The gathering was in
fact a &ldquo;working party&rdquo; for the approaching
bazaar. But the real work of bazaars is
not done at parties.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the Aunt was saying, &ldquo;so nice for
dear Julia. I&rsquo;m truly glad that she should
begin her visit with a little gaiety. In
parting or sorrow we should always seek to
distract the mind, should we not, dear Mrs
Biddle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The young are all too easily distracted
by the shows of this world,&rdquo; said dear Mrs
Biddle heavily.</p>

<p>And several ladies murmured approval.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t exactly call a church bazaar
the shows of this world, can you?&rdquo; urged
the Aunt, sitting very upright, all black
and beady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the thin end of the Rubicon sometimes,&rdquo;
said Mrs Biddle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
&ldquo;Then why&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began the youngest Tabby&mdash;and
then the door bell rang, and every one
said: &ldquo;Here she is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prim maid announced her, and she
took two steps forward, and stood blinking
in the gaslight with her hat on one side,
and no gloves. Every one noticed that at
once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in, my dear,&rdquo; said the Aunt, rustling
forward. &ldquo;I have a few friends this afternoon,
and&mdash;Oh, my gracious, what has happened!&rdquo;</p>

<p>What had happened was quite simple. In
her rustling advance some wandering trail
of the Aunt&rsquo;s black beadiness had caught
on the knotted fringe of the table-cloth, and
drawn this after her. A mass of silk and
lace and ribbon lay sprinkled along the
edges of the table where the Tabbies sat; a
good store of needles, scissors, and cotton
reels mingled with it. Now all this swept
to the floor on the moving table-cloth, at
the very instant when a rough brownly-black,
long-eared person with a sharp nose and
very muddy paws bounded into the room,
to the full length of his chain. His bound
landed him in the very middle of the ribbon-lace-cotton-reel
confusion. Judy caught
the dog up in her arms, and her apologies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
would have melted my heart, or yours, dear
reader, in an instant. But Tabbies are
Tabbies, and a bazaar is a bazaar. No more
sewing was done that day; what was left of
the afternoon proved all too short for the
disentangling, the partial cleansing of the
desecrated lace-cotton-reel-silk-muddle.
And Alcibiades was tied up in the back-kitchen
to the wheel of the patent mangle;
he howled without ceasing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said the Aunt, when tea was
over, and the last Tabby had found her
goloshes and gone home in them, &ldquo;you are
most welcome under any roof of mine, but&mdash;(may
I ask you to close the baize door
at the top of the kitchen stairs&mdash;thank you&mdash;and
now this one&mdash;I am obliged. One
cannot hear oneself speak for that terrible
animal)&mdash;you must get rid of the cur
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Aunt! he&rsquo;s not a cur&mdash;he&rsquo;s pure-bred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the Aunt, &ldquo;I believe
I am as good a judge of dogs as any lady.
My own dear Snubs has only been dead a
year and two months last Tuesday. I know
that a well-bred dog should have smooth
hair, at any rate&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
The mother of Snubs had been distantly
related to a family of respectable middle-class
fox-terriers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; said Judy. She meant
apology, but the Aunt took it for sympathy,
and softened somewhat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A nice little smooth-coated dog now,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;a fox-terrier, or an Italian greyhound;
you see I am not ignorant of the
names of various patterns of dog. I will
get you one myself; we will go to the
Dogs&rsquo; Home at Battersea, where really nice
dogs are often sold quite cheap. Or perhaps
they might take your poor cur in exchange.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy began to cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, cry, my dear,&rdquo; said the Aunt
kindly; &ldquo;it will do you a world of good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the Aunt was asleep&mdash;she had closed
her ears to the protests of Alcibiades with
wadding left over from a handkerchief sachet&mdash;Judy
crept down in her woolly white dressing-gown,
and coaxed the kitchen fire back
to life. Then she sat in front of it, on the
speckless rag carpet, and nursed Alcibiades
and scolded him, and explained that he
really must be a good dog, and that we all
have something to put up with in this life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know, Alby dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
not very nice for me either, but <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t
howl and try to upset mangles. Don&rsquo;t you
be afraid, dear: you shan&rsquo;t go to the Dogs&rsquo;
Home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So kindly, yet strongly, did she urge her
point that Alcibiades, tied to the leg of the
kitchen table, consented to sleep quietly for
the rest of the night.</p>

<p>Next day, when the Aunt enquired
searchingly as to Judy&rsquo;s powers of fancywork,
and what she would do for the
bazaar, Judy declared outright that she did
not know one end of a needle from the
other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I can paint a little,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
I am rather good at wood-carving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will be very nice.&rdquo; The Aunt
already saw, in fancy, her stall outshine
those of all other Tabbies, with glories of
sabots and tambourines decorated with rosy
sprays &ldquo;hand-painted,&rdquo; and carved white
wood boxes just the size to hold nothing
useful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll do you some,&rdquo; said Judy; &ldquo;only
I can&rsquo;t work if I&rsquo;m distracted about Alby&mdash;my
dog, you know. Oh, Aunt, <i>do</i> let him
stay! He really is valuable, and he hasn&rsquo;t
made a bit of noise since last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
&ldquo;It is quite useless,&rdquo; the Aunt was sternly
beginning&mdash;then suddenly her voice changed.
&ldquo;Is the cur <i>really</i> valuable?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle Reggie gave five guineas for him
when he was a baby boy,&rdquo; said Judy eagerly,
&ldquo;and he&rsquo;s worth much more now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he must be very old&mdash;when your
Uncle Reggie was a boy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean when Alcibiades was a boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who is Alcibiades?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy began all over again, and urged one
or two new points.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be harsh,&rdquo; said the Aunt
at last, &ldquo;you <i>shall</i> have the little breakfast
room to paint and carve in as you suggest.
Of course I couldn&rsquo;t have shavings and paint
pots lying about all over the dining-room
and drawing-room. And you shall keep your
cur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Aunty,&rdquo; cried Judy, &ldquo;you are a
darling!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the Aunt went on complacently,
&ldquo;you shall keep your cur till the bazaar, and
then we will sell it for the benefit of the
Fund for the Amelioration of the Daughters
of the Country Clergy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And from this decision no tears and no
entreaties would move her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
Judy made a den for herself and Alcibiades
in the little breakfast room. There was no
painting light&mdash;so she looked out a handful
of the sketches that she had done last summer
and framed them. Most of her time she
spent in writing to her friends to know
whether any one could take care of a darling
dog, who was a perfect angel. And alas! no
one could&mdash;or would.</p>

<p>With the connivance of the cook, Alcibiades
had a bed in a box in the den, and from the
very first he would at a word conceal himself
in it the moment the step of the Aunt
sounded on the oil-cloth-covered stairs. The
sketches were framed, and some of the
frames were lightly carved. The Aunt was
enchanted, but, on the subject of Alcibiades,
adamant.</p>

<p>And now it was the day of the bazaar.
Judy had run wires along the wall of the
schoolroom behind her Aunt&rsquo;s stall, and
from it hung the best of the sketches. She
had arranged the stall herself, glorifying it
with the Eastern shawls and draperies that
her father had sent her from India. It did
far outshine any other stall, even that of
Lady Bates, the wife of the tallow Knight.
The Aunt was really grateful&mdash;truly appreciative.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
But her mind was made up about the
&ldquo;cur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it really <i>is</i> worth anything we&rsquo;ll sell
it. If not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She paused on the dark hint,
and Judy&rsquo;s miserable fancy lost itself among
ropes and rivers and rat-poison.</p>

<p>To Alcibiades the bazaar was as much a
festival as to any Tabby of them all. He
had been washed, which is terrible at the
time, but makes you self-respecting afterwards,
a little puffed-up even. He had been
allowed to come out by the front door,
with his mistress in her beautiful dress that
reminded him of rabbits. No one but
Alcibiades himself will ever know what
tortures of shame and misery, fighting with
joy and affection, he had endured on those
other occasions when he had been smuggled
out of the back door in the early morning
to take the damp air with his beloved lady
and she had worn a shabby mackintosh and
a red tam-o-shanter. To-day he wore a
blue ribbon; it was uncomfortable, but he
knew it spelt distinction. He rode in a
carriage. It was not like the little governess-cart
which had carried him and his mistress
through the lanes about Maidstone; but it
was a carriage, and a large horse was his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
slave. His mistress herself had tied his blue
ribbon; it was she, too, who adjusted the chain
that attached him to a strong staple driven
in just above the schoolroom wainscotting.
The chain allowed him to sit at her feet as
she stood by the stall waiting for purchasers,
and scanning the face of each newcomer in
an eager anxiety to find there the countenance
of some one who really loved dogs.</p>

<p>But the people were most awful, and she
had to own it to herself. There were Tabbies
by the dozen, and young ladies by the score&mdash;young
ladies all dressed differently, yet all
alike in the fashion of the year before last;
all vacant-faced, smiling agreeably because
they knew they ought to smile&mdash;the young
of the Tabby kind&mdash;Tabby kittens, in fact.
No doubt they were really worthy and
interesting, but they did not seem so to
Judy.</p>

<p>There was a sprinkling of men&mdash;middle-aged
mostly, and bald. There were a few
youths; by some fatality all were fair, and
reminded Judy of pork. A Tabby stopped at
her stall, turned over all things and bought
a beaded table-napkin ring. The purchase
and the purchaser seemed to Judy to typify
her whole life and surroundings. All her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
soul reached out to the Island. She sighed,
then she looked up. The crowd had thickened
since she last surveyed it. Four steps led
down to the schoolroom from the outer world:
on the top step was a lady, well dressed&mdash;oh!
marvel!&mdash;and beside her a man&mdash;a gentleman.
Well, Judy supposed all these poor dear people
were gentlefolk, but these two were of her
world. As she gazed her eyes and those of
the man met; the lady was lost in the crowd,
and Judy saw her no more. The man made
straight for the stall where were the framed
sketches, the white dress, fur-trimmed, the
russet hair and green eyes of Judy, and the
brownly-black, blue-ribboned Alcibiades. But
before he reached them a wave of buyers
broke on the shore of Judy&rsquo;s stall, and he had
been watching her for nearly half an hour
before a young woman&rsquo;s long-deferred choice
of a Christmas gift for a grandfather fell
happily on a pair of purple bed-socks, and, for
the moment, Judy breathed free.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; said the Aunt, rattling
money in a leather bag; &ldquo;I <i>knew</i> just before
Christmas was <i>the</i> time. Everybody <i>has</i> to
give Christmas presents to all their relations.
You see! the things are going like wildfire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Aunt,&rdquo; said Judy. Alcibiades took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
advantage of the momentary calm to lick her
hand exhaustively. Judy wondered wearily
what had become of the man, the only man
in that cheerless assembly who looked as
though he liked dogs. &ldquo;He must have been
trying to get somewhere else,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;he
just looked in here by mistake, and when he
saw the sort of people we were, he&mdash;well&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; she sighed, and, raising her eyes,
met his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said he. He meant
apology.</p>

<p>She took it for enquiry, and smiled. &ldquo;Do
you want to buy something?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>Her smile was more tired than she knew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I do,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;one does at
bazaars, don&rsquo;t you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want a Christmas present?&rdquo; asked
Judy, businesslike; &ldquo;if so, and if you will
tell me what kind of relation you want it
for, perhaps I can find something that they&rsquo;d
like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you? Now, that is really good.
I want things for two aunts, three cousins,
a little sister, and my mother&mdash;but I needn&rsquo;t
get <i>hers</i> here unless you&rsquo;ve got something
you think really&mdash;By Jove!&rdquo;&mdash;his eyes had
caught the sketches&mdash;&ldquo;are <i>those</i> for sale?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
&ldquo;That is rather the idea,&rdquo; said Judy. Her
spirits were rising, though she couldn&rsquo;t have
told you why. &ldquo;Things at a bazaar are
usually for sale, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything?&rdquo; said he&mdash;and he stroked the
not resentful neck of Alcibiades; &ldquo;this good
little beast isn&rsquo;t in the market, I&rsquo;m afraid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why? Would you buy him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d think twice before I said no. My
mother is frightfully fond of dogs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quite unreasonably Judy felt that she did
not want to sell Alcibiades as a present to
any one&rsquo;s mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sketches,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sketches,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;why, there&rsquo;s
Maidstone Church and Farley and Teston
Lock and Allington. How much are they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She told him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must have some. May I have a dozen?
They&rsquo;re disgracefully cheap, and I feel like
an American pork man buying works of art
by the dozen&mdash;for they <i>are</i> jolly good&mdash;and
it brings back old times. I was quartered
there once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; she said to herself. Alcibiades
stood up with his paws on her arm. &ldquo;Be
quiet,&rdquo; she said to him; &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t talk
now, I&rsquo;m busy.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
Alcibiades gave her a reproachful look, and
lay down.</p>

<p>The stranger smiled; a very jolly smile,
Judy thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ripping little beast, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; said the
stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re invalided home?&rdquo; she
said. She couldn&rsquo;t help it. A man in the
Service. One who had been quartered at
Maidstone, her own dear Maidstone. He
was no longer a stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;beastly bore. But I shall
be all right in two or three months; I hope
the fighting won&rsquo;t be all over by then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you sold this gentleman anything?&rdquo;
said the Aunt firmly, &ldquo;because Mrs Biddle
wants to look at some d&rsquo;oyleys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just selling something,&rdquo; answered
Judy. Then she turned to him and spoke
softly. &ldquo;I say, do you really like dogs?&rdquo;
said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I do.&rdquo; The young man opened
surprised grey eyes at her, as who should
say: &ldquo;Now, do I look like a man who doesn&rsquo;t
like dogs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Alcibiades <i>is</i> for
sale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that his name? Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh, surely you know: wasn&rsquo;t it Alcibiades
who gave up being dictator or something
rather than have his dog&rsquo;s ears cut off?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I seem to remember something of the
sort,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;his price is twenty
guineas, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He whistled very softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll&mdash;yes,
Aunt, in one moment!&rdquo; She went on in an
agonised undertone: &ldquo;His price is twenty
guineas. Say you&rsquo;ll have him. Say it <i>loud</i>.
You won&rsquo;t really have to pay anything for
him&mdash;No, I&rsquo;m not mad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you twenty guineas for the dog,&rdquo;
said the man, standing straight and soldierly
against the tumbled mass of mats and pin-cushions
and chair-backs.</p>

<p>The Aunt drew a long breath and turned
to minister to Mrs Biddle&rsquo;s deep need of
d&rsquo;oyleys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come and have tea,&rdquo; said the stranger;
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re tired out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I can&rsquo;t. Of course I can&rsquo;t&mdash;but
I&rsquo;ll take you over to Mrs Piddock&rsquo;s
stall and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She led him away. &ldquo;Look
here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re a decent
sort. Here&rsquo;s the money to pay for him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
My aunt says if I don&rsquo;t sell him she&rsquo;ll have
him killed. Will you keep him for me till
my people come home? Oh, do&mdash;he really
<i>is</i> an angel. And give me your name and
address. You must think me a maniac, but
I am so horribly fond of him. Will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I will,&rdquo; he said heartily, &ldquo;but
I shall pay for him. I&rsquo;ll write a cheque:
you can pay me when you get him back.
Thank you&mdash;yes, I am sure that pin-cushion
would delight my aunt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy, with burning cheeks, found her way
back to her stall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Alcibiades,&rdquo; she said, unfastening the
blue ribbon, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s nice. Don&rsquo;t
bite him, there&rsquo;s a dear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A cheque signed &ldquo;Richard Graeme&rdquo; and
a card with an address came into Judy&rsquo;s
hands, and the chain of Alcibiades left them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;ll be good to him,&rdquo; she
said; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t give him meat, only biscuit,
and sulphur in his drinking water. But
you know all that. You&rsquo;ve got me out
of a frightful hole, and I&rsquo;ll bless you as
long as I live. Good-bye.&rdquo; She stooped to
the Aberdeen, now surprised and pained.
&ldquo;Good-bye, my dear old boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Alcibiades, stubborn resistance in every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
line of his figure, in every hair of his coat,
was dragged away through the crowded
bazaar.</p>

<p>Judy went to bed very tired. The bazaar
had been a success, and the success had been
talked over and the money counted till late
in the evening&mdash;nearly eleven, that is, which
is late for Tabbies&mdash;yet she woke at four.
Some one was calling her. It was&mdash;no, he
was gone&mdash;her eyes pricked at the thought&mdash;yet&mdash;surely
that could be the voice of
no other than Alcibiades? She sat up in
bed and listened. It was he! That was
his dear voice whining at the side gate.
Those were his darling paws scratching the
sacred paint off it.</p>

<p>Judy swept down the stairs like a silent
whirlwind, turned key, drew bolts, and in
a moment she and the cur were &ldquo;sobbing
in each other&rsquo;s arms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She carried him up to her room, washed
his dear, muddy paws, and spread her golf
cape that he might lie on the bed beside
her.</p>

<p>In chilliest, earliest dawn she rose and
dressed. She found a wire that had supported
her pictures at the bazaar, and she wrote a
note and tied it to the collar of Alcibiades,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
where she noticed and untied a frayed end
of rope. This was the note:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;He has run home to me. Why did you
take the chain off? He always bites through
cord. Don&rsquo;t beat him for it; he&rsquo;ll soon forget
me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The tears came into her eyes as she wrote
it; it seemed to her so very pathetic. She
did not quite believe that Alcibiades would
soon forget her&mdash;but if he did&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>The note did not lack pathos, either, in the
eyes of Captain Graeme, when, two hours
later, he found it under the chin of a mournfully
howling Alcibiades, securely attached by
picture wire to the railings of his mother&rsquo;s
house.</p>

<p>The Captain took a turn on the Heath,
and thought. And his thoughts were these:
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the prettiest girl I&rsquo;ve seen since I
came home. It&rsquo;s deuced dull here. Shouldn&rsquo;t
wonder if she&rsquo;s dull too, poor little girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he went home and cut a glove in
pieces and sewed the pieces together, slowly
but solidly as soldiers and sailors do sew. So
that when, two nights later, the claws and the
voice of Alcibiades roused Judy from sleep&mdash;her
aunt most fortunately slept on the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
side of the house&mdash;she found, after the first
rapturous hug of reunion, a something under
the hand that caressed the neck of Alcibiades.</p>

<p>The gaslight in her own room defined the
something as a bag of leather, the tan leather
of which gentlemen&rsquo;s gloves are made. There
was a bit of worn strap hanging below it.
Within was a note.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;A thousand thanks for bringing him home.
If he <i>should</i> run away again, please let me
know. And don&rsquo;t trouble to send him back.
I&rsquo;ll call for him, if I may.</p>

<p class="right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Richard Graeme</span>.&rdquo;
</p></div>

<p>Judy would very much have liked to let
Captain Graeme call, but there are such
things as aunts.</p>

<p>She tied another note to the &ldquo;cur&rsquo;s&rdquo; collar
and wired him once more to the Paragon
House railings. The note said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use. He can bite through leather.
Do use a chain.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Next time Alcibiades returned he dragged a
half yard of fine chain. It was neatly filed,
but Judy was a woman and the detail escaped
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
That morning she and Alcibiades slept late,
the dressing-bell was ringing as she woke.</p>

<p>The cook helped; the Aunt most fortunately
had a luncheon engagement with a Tabby in
Sidcup. Alcibiades being promised a walk
later, consented to wait, trifling with a bone,
in silence and the coal cellar. At eleven Judy
rewarded his patience. She went out with
him, and somehow it seemed wise to put on
a pleasant-coloured dress, and one&rsquo;s best furs
and one&rsquo;s prettiest hat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I shall see him,&rdquo; she told
herself; &ldquo;but,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;I am much more
afraid that my aunt will see Alcibiades.&rdquo; On
the edge of the Heath she met him. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
the dear dog,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Oh, can&rsquo;t you find a
stronger chain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What a ripping day,
isn&rsquo;t it? Oh, are you going straight back? I
wish we&rsquo;d met anywhere but at a bazaar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; she said heartfeltly, and caressed
the now careless Aberdeen: it was at a
bazaar that she had had to sell that angel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mayn&rsquo;t I walk home with you?&rdquo; he said.
And she could not think of any polite way
of saying no, though she knew just how
terrible Alcibiades would make the final
parting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
Next morning the chain dragged by
Alcibiades was slightly thicker; it also was
filed, and this too Judy failed to notice.
Early as it was she did not go out in the
mackintosh but in something simple and
blue, with kingfisher&rsquo;s wings in her hat.</p>

<p>The morning was thinly bright. Alcibiades
saw a cat and chased it towards Morden
College just as Judy met Captain Graeme.
It was, for her, impossible not to follow the
&ldquo;cur.&rdquo; And how could the Captain do otherwise
than follow, too? And if two people
walk together it is churlish not to talk.</p>

<p>Next day the chain was thicker, the hour
propitious, and the walk longer; that was the
day when she found out that he had known
her father in South Africa.</p>

<p>The days passed with a delightful monotony.
The Aunt and her pet Tabbies all day, a sound
sleep, an early waking, a heavenly meeting
with Alcibiades at the back door, the restoring
of him to his master. And every day the
chain grew heavier, the walks longer, the talks
more interesting and more intimate.</p>

<p>It was very wrong, of course, but what
was the girl to do? You cannot be rude
to a man who is saving your dog, your
darling, from rat-poisons, rivers and ropes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
And if dogs <i>will</i> break chains, why&mdash;so
will girls.</p>

<p>It was on Christmas Day that the spell
was shattered. Judy awoke at the accustomed
time, but no welcome whine, no pathetic
scrabble of eager paws broke the respectable
stillness of the Aunt&rsquo;s house. Judy listened.
She even crept down to the side gate. A feeling
of misery, of real physical faintness came
over her. Alcibiades was not there! he had
not come! He had, indeed, forgotten her.</p>

<p>The conviction that the master of Alcibiades
would be the last to appreciate the new
attachment of his dog comforted her a little;
but for all that the day was grey, life seemed
well-nigh worthless. Judy now had leisure
to reconsider her position, and she was not
pleased with herself. It was in the thick of
the Christmas beef that the thought awoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>He</i> is tired of meeting me; he has locked
Alcibiades up. If he hadn&rsquo;t, the darling <i>must</i>
have come.&rdquo; Since this solution left Alcibiades
without a stain upon his faithful character,
it ought to have been comforting, but it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>She felt her cheeks flush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gracious, child,&rdquo; said the Aunt,
&ldquo;what are you turning that curious purple
colour for? If the fire&rsquo;s too much for you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
let Mary put the screen to the back of your
chair, for goodness&rsquo; sake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the plum-pudding&rsquo;s remains had
passed away and the perfunctory dessert
was over the Aunt retired to rest.</p>

<p>Judy was left to face the grey afternoon
alone. She sat staring into the fire till her
eyes ached. She felt very lonely, very injured,
very forlorn. There was a footfall on the
steps&mdash;a manly tread; a knock at the door&mdash;a
kind of I have-a-perfect-right-to-knock-here-if-I-like
sort of knock.</p>

<p>Judy jumped up to look in the glass and
pat her hair, for no one but an idiot could
have helped knowing who it was that stepped
and knocked.</p>

<p>He came in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What luck! I asked
for the Aunt. Meant to say Friend of your
Father&rsquo;s, and all that. But this is better.
Judy, I couldn&rsquo;t stand it.... She&rsquo;s coming.
I can hear her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was indeed a sound of stout house
boots trampling overhead, of drawers being
pulled out, of wardrobe doors being opened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish everything was different,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;but, oh Judy, darling, do say yes! say it
now, this minute; and then when she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
comes down I can tell her we&rsquo;re engaged&mdash;see?&rdquo;</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well,&rdquo; said Judy, two hours
later, when, with the licence of an engaged
young lady, she said good-bye to her lover
at the front door. &ldquo;You say you do&mdash;and&mdash;and
yes, of course, I&rsquo;m glad&mdash;but Alcibiades
doesn&rsquo;t love me any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he? you wait till I bring him
to-morrow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he never came this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor little beast! Judy, the fact is I&rsquo;ve
gone on making the chain heavier and heavier,
and this morning&mdash;well, it was too much for
him. He couldn&rsquo;t drag it all the way: it
was a regular ship&rsquo;s cable, don&rsquo;t you know?
I came up with him at Blackheath Station,
and he was so done I had to carry him all
the way home in my arms. He&rsquo;s quite all
right again now; I left him at home, tied
to the fire-irons in my bedroom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he <i>does</i> love me, after all,&rdquo; said
Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s not the only one,&rdquo; said the
Captain.</p>

<p>And at that moment came from the other
side of the front door the familiar whine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
the well-known scratching mingled with
strange clanking noises.</p>

<p>Next instant three happy people were
embracing on the door-mat amid the sobs
of Judy, the laughter of her lover, the yelps
of Alcibiades, and the deafening rattle of a
poker, a pair of tongs, and half a shovel.<br /></p>
